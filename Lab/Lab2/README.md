Dataflow is a managed service for executing a wide variety of data processing patterns. When you run your pipeline with the Cloud Dataflow service, the runner uploads your executable code and dependencies to a Google Cloud Storage bucket and creates a Cloud Dataflow job, which executes your pipeline on managed resources in Google Cloud Platform.[1](https://medium.com/google-cloud/basic-streaming-data-enrichment-on-google-cloud-with-dataflow-sql-a7684353119c)

Datalab is used to build Machine Learning (ML) models and runs on Googleâ€™s Cloud virtual machine. BigQuery is cloud-based big data analytics web service for processing very large read-only data sets, using SQL-like syntax.
