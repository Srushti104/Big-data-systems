# Lab 6 - SEVIR : A Storm Event Imagery Dataset for Deep Learning Applications in Radar and Satellite Meteorology

The Storm EVent ImagRy dataset (SEVIR), a dataset designed for advancing machine learning for meteorology. SEVIR contains image sequences for over 10,000 weather events that cover 384 km x 384 km patches and span 4 hours. Images in SEVIR were sampled and aligned across 5 different sensing modalities: three channels (C02, C09, C13) from the GOES-16 advanced baseline imager (ABI) [22], NEXRAD derived vertically integrated liquid (VIL) mosaics created by the FAA’s NextGenWeather processor Testbed [4], and GOES-16 Geostationary Lightning Mapper (GLM) flashes [11]. Events in SEVIR were carefully sampled to ensure the dataset contains
relevant severe storm cases. The main contributions of our work are summarized below:  
• Publicly available terabyte-sized SEVIR dataset of 10,000 weather events aligned across 5
imaging modalities.  
• Detailed overview of two machine learning applications that can be studied using SEVIR.  
• Source code for data readers, baseline model implementations, metrics, loss functions and
trained models for Nowcast and Synthetic Weather Radar applications.
