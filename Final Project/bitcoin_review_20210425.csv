My first deposits and withdrawals were without any problem, but soon it got worse.Average time of withdrawal is 1 and half hours and it takes 30-60 minutes to get your deposit credited. For example I was credited my deposit after 59 confirmations, while on other exchanges it is after 5-6 confirmations.Otherwise there is nothing wrong with this exchange, so if you like to just hold and trade your coins I don't see any reason to not use this exchange.""]"

I tried to enquirer as to best resolve this but my questions go unanswered. I was informed that I can spend my crypto currency but my privileges have been revoked.
