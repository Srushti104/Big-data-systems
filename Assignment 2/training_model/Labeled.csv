Garo Armen,-0.023363035870715976,NEUTRAL
Good morning. Thank you very much. In       our pipeline continued to grow with an arsenal of agents designed to activate the immune system across different types of patients and cancers on one hand  while also addressing immunotherapy resistance pathways across many tumor types and the other.,0.4761974765569903,POSITIVE
We expect these advances will contribute to the I-O field on multiple fronts. For instance  we are advancing AGEN     s clinical development and generating responses in patients who are unlikely to otherwise respond to immunotherapy.,0.019017105572856963,NEUTRAL
We expect to advance AGEN     to registrational studies this year. We ve also made substantial advances with our TIGIT programs  demonstrating the unique attributes of our bispecific antibody  which is IND-ready.,0.1305794392246753,NEUTRAL
One of our notable achievements during      was the completion of patient enrollment and data analysis of our two most clinically advanced agents  balstilimab  which is our PD-  antibody  and zalifrelimab  which is our first-generation CTLA-  antibody. We call these bal and zal for short.,0.4017303410801105,POSITIVE
We are progressing with the completion of our BLA filing for bal and will proceed with our strategy regarding the potential bal plus zal filing  once bal s BLA filing has been accepted. It is our aim to use balstilimab as the foundation for several of our pipeline agents as well as offer our bal for use with therapies from other companies  which require combination with a PD-  blocker. Our objective is to rapidly enable synergistic combinations to advance the field.,0.041758889907214325,NEUTRAL
Synergistic combinations for our agents include cell therapies through our subsidiary AgenTus. While we are continuing our allogeneic intelligent iNKT cell therapy in patients with COVID-    we will be advancing these intelligent cells into cancer trials with combinations around mid-year.,0.006147445055830758,NEUTRAL
Separately  at a time when the world s need for higher quantities of vaccine production grows  we are advancing our plans for producing high quantities of QS-   adjuvant from a renewable source.,0.031314609688706696,NEUTRAL
QS-   is an antigen-sparing adjuvant. What that means is that a vaccine formulation with QS-   may require as little as    -fold less antigen to achieve the same immune response.,0.0418863482773304,NEUTRAL
If this proves to be the case for some or most COVID-   vaccines  you can appreciate the potential implications of QS-   to be able to significantly increase global COVID-   manufacturing capacity -- that is vaccine manufacturing capacity without the need to add additional antigen production capabilities which is one of the major bottlenecks of today.,-0.05109625309705734,NEUTRAL
Several of these advancements I touched upon represent important milestones. We expect some of those to result in cash accretive corporate transactions starting in the second quarter of this year.,0.039205170003697276,NEUTRAL
In       we built on Agenus  foundation of innovation and integration. These are -- that is innovation and integration  are the key pillars of our business model. While COVID has posed challenges for many  including Agenus  we were early to anticipate and adjust to life in the very early stages of the pandemic.,0.027864934629178606,NEUTRAL
We ve also rapidly adjusted to address new needs such as iNKT cell therapy in patients with more severe infections of COVID-   who are dependent on life support. We published early data from the trial and expect to share more as our trial matures. Our teams are also preparing for the scenario of a rapid or emergency use path for iNKT cell therapy should the trial data look encouraging.,0.058069097402039915,NEUTRAL
But with all these adjustments  our whole mission is unchanged. We will continue to innovate and advance our programs with speed. This requires integrated capabilities to reduce our dependence on outsiders on one hand  but also very importantly retaining and continuing to acquire high talent.,0.11896512855309993,NEUTRAL
High talent density is key to our ability to deliver innovation. Recently  we welcomed stunning talent into our leadership team  and I will start with Dr. Steven O Day  our Chief Medical Officer  and our Chief Commercial Officer  Andy Hurley. These two professionals are among some of the most respected names in the field.,0.4281841449846979,POSITIVE
Dr. O Day is a pioneer in immuno-oncology  and as a clinical investigator he has been an important contributor to the success we ve seen so far with AGEN    . As we advance in the discovery and development of high-performing immune therapies and particularly combinations  we need to have formidable players like Dr. O Day on our team.,0.3458717185858404,POSITIVE
Dr. O Day played a key role in the successful development of Yervoy and Opdivo CTLA-  and PD-  agents as well as several other cancer therapies. He has the knowledge and expertise to build on our work with      cemented in place in the IO landscape and fully maximize the compound s potential as a blockbuster therapy for cancer patients.,0.1597560756126768,NEUTRAL
We have big plans for AGEN      and we ll pursue accelerated pathways to advance the molecule to the market. Andy Hurley will be a key driver of our aspirations to do this. In his role as Chief Commercial Officer  Andy joined us after three decades of building teams and commercializing product in biopharma. With the balstilimab BLA filing expected in the first half of this year  Andy will help establish Agenus as a commercial company with balstilimab as a key actor in our plans for our ambitious combination strategies.,0.108061164180981,NEUTRAL
Given our mission to develop impactful combinations for patients  Agenus requires clinical scientists with extensive and established expertise. Dr. Joe Grossman joined our team as Head of Exploratory Medicine from Harvard and Beth Israel. His specialty includes colorectal and pancreatic cancers. Dr. Grossman will drive our translational medicine strategy  which is a key aspect of Agenus  clinical development strategy.,0.07851540853516781,NEUTRAL
Dr. Jason Paragas  another recent addition to our team is an expert in data analysis and artificial intelligence. He formerly served with DARPA  working on threat detection for the U.S. government and associated defense departments. Jason joined us as Vice President of Strategic Initiatives. Jason will also be working with our team to industrialize and broaden the applications of our VISION response prediction technology. Next  Adam Krauss joined as Chief Legal and Compliance Officer to ensure our commercial readiness  and Marc Wiles joined as Vice President of Regulatory Affairs.,0.04876433609024389,NEUTRAL
It is a transformative period for Agenus and the value each of these team members bring will help drive a new level of success for the company. We understand the ambitious scale of our mission as we seek to disrupt an industry that has been challenged with disruptive demands. We believe marshalling the best people and resources is paramount to achieving success.,0.23875871545897098,NEUTRAL
I would now like to turn the call over to our President and Chief Operating Officer  Dr. Jennifer Buell.,0.06103072315454483,NEUTRAL
Jennifer Buell,0.0014714345597894862,NEUTRAL
Thank you Garo. As Garo indicated  our R D engine has been enormously productive with numerous discoveries  IND filings  and product candidates advancing in late-stage trials. As a result       was a period of significant data flow. We presented data updates on our programs at all of the leading oncology conferences last year. At SITC  AACR and ASCO  we presented data on clinical responses with       as well as the differentiation of our five lead molecules. And finally  we also presented data on our response predictive -- prediction platform VISION.,0.3164578736468684,POSITIVE
With our TIGIT bispecific  AGEN      we presented data revealing the potential to broaden the activity beyond first generation of anti-TIGIT antibodies. We ve engineered an important region of the molecule the Fc region to improve responses  expand the population of responders  and generate monotherapy activity  which is not currently seen with TIGIT monospecific antibodies available today.,0.0145679691049736,NEUTRAL
More recently at ESMO just a few months ago  we presented preliminary data from the balstilimab monotherapy and bal zal combination studies  showing breakthrough activity in PD-L  positive and PD-L  negative cervical cancer patients. As we look into      including AACR next month  we will continue our aggressive approach to data presentation  providing clinical updates on our lead compounds including AGEN    .,0.015482909977436066,NEUTRAL
On our BLA filings  our rolling BLA filing for balstilimab monotherapy in second-line cervical cancer is underway. Initiated in September  we expect to complete the filing during the first half of this year. And as we disclosed in September  this timeline accommodates two additional late confirmed responders seen in our pivotal trial. We ll provide the FDA with six months of follow-up on those patients  as well as   -month median follow-up on all trial participants. We believe balstilimab s approval would represent a meaningful new option for the cervical cancer community.,0.01845350582152605,NEUTRAL
We note that pembrolizumab  KEYTRUDA is approved in the PD-L  positive population only and shows no clinical responses in PD-L  negative tumors. And in the largest IO clinical trial in this population to date in over     patients treated with balstilimab alone  we reported response rates of     in PD-L  positive patients and     in PD-L  negative patients. This compares favorably to KEYTRUDA  which has     responses in PD-L  positive tumors and no responses in PD-L  negative tumors.,0.008021618472412229,NEUTRAL
In addition  the durability of response in our pivotal trial was impressive  lasting approximately   .  months. This is not observed with chemotherapeutic options currently available for these patients.,0.4347612224519253,POSITIVE
The duration of response is a hallmark of effective IO agents and ours far exceeds the limited duration of response  observed with chemotherapy for these patients. We believe  these clinical data  reveal emerging differential features of balstilimab.,0.053943592065479606,NEUTRAL
We plan to publish the full clinical data set of balstilimab  in refractory cervical cancer in a high-profile journal. Additionally  we will publish pre-clinical data from our vision platform  that further elucidates  bal s superior  tumor cell killing capabilities  compared to the leading commercially available PD-  antibodies.,0.023304452566662803,NEUTRAL
Regarding our plans for the balstilimab plus zalifrelimab BLA filing  we ve been in ongoing discussions with the FDA. The trial has completed enrollment. The patients have concluded the median of    months of follow-up. And we re collecting data  on late responses  in this trial as well.,0.03805197891779244,NEUTRAL
The data continues to improve as it matures  with response rates and most importantly  duration of those responses. Agenus will continue to keep the agency informed of additional data advancements. And as Garo just discussed  we plan to disclose the timing and strategy regarding bal  and zal  once bal s FDA filing has been accepted.,0.03977417730493471,NEUTRAL
Our first approval with balstilimab would mark a strategic milestone for Agenus. Having our own approved PD-  inhibitor would allow us the freedom and flexibility  for the development and commercial pricing of our combination regimens  with our own IO compounds  including CTLA-   TIGIT and novel molecules targeting myeloid pathways and beyond.,0.07550428347894922,NEUTRAL
In addition  we see a significant opportunity with our PD-   in combination with potential partnered programs. Regarding       to the emerging clinical profile of       again this is also an engineered antibody.,0.1342188428970985,NEUTRAL
We ve engineered the Fc region of the antibody  to improve its features. We designed       for superior efficacy with improved T cell priming and the capability to deplete  suppressive intra-tumoral regulatory T cells.,0.169904159498401,NEUTRAL
We ve also designed the molecule for better safety  avoiding complement-mediated toxicities and to broaden the patient population  who can benefit from CTLA- . That s because of improved binding to CD  . And we re seeing activity in patients  with both the low affinity and the high-affinity CD   allele.,0.2360603686538525,NEUTRAL
We believe AGEN     continues to show nothing less than extraordinary promise  as a differentiated anti-CTLA- . This potential is upheld  in the new data Agenus announced early in February that describes new  confirmed responses.,0.08936232887208462,NEUTRAL
As of February  a total of six confirmed responses with      monotherapy and      plus bal have been recorded -- reported in colon  ovarian and endometrial cancers  including two complete responses.,-0.015234931372106075,NEUTRAL
Further  we ve seen responses in cold tumors. These are tumors that have low tumor mutational burden  microsatellite stable disease and PD-L  negative tumors as well as BRCA negative tumors and tumors with a low affinity CD   allele.,-0.004907354057650082,NEUTRAL
This is what makes      unique. These are tumors where current IO therapy is largely ineffective. In addition  no debilitating neuroendocrine toxicities or liver toxicities have been observed  unlike what we see in patients treated with Yervoy  experiencing     to     toxicities.,0.14711971580982208,NEUTRAL
Looking ahead with       currently in Phase   development  our goal is a fast-to-market strategy  targeting indications that currently have few effective treatments. And in patients who have failed prior standard therapies.,0.08464952744543552,NEUTRAL
Trials are continuing with      alone  and in combination with balstilimab  with expanded cohorts  in microsatellite stable colorectal cancer  microsatellite stable endometrial cancer  non-small cell lung cancer and melanoma.,0.004156167298788205,NEUTRAL
With continued positive clinical data a registrational program expected to begin by the end of this year and it s with great excitement that we brought on board Dr. Steven O Day  an expert in delivering effective IO agents to patients with cancer.,0.46849606779869646,POSITIVE
AGEN     alone and as the backbone of high-impact combination could be a foundational therapy  if approved  driving the next wave of IO treatments. Our initial registrational plan will focus on indications for rapid launch through the accelerated approval pathway as a monotherapy or on top of our PD-  or any approved PD- .,0.007680234397412278,NEUTRAL
Based on our preclinical and clinical data to-date  our ambitions with      plus PD-  are to be the dominant IO combination with the potential to overtake Yervoy and Opdivo or chemo and KEYTRUDA as the market leader. We re actively seeking the right partner to execute this strategy and dominate in this sector.,0.029357923893257976,NEUTRAL
At the upcoming AACR conference in April we ll present two abstracts featuring AGEN     alone and in combination with other IO mechanisms such as our anti-PD-  therapy  balstilimab. We ll showcase how the unique design of this molecule is expanding the benefit of this important target to drive responses in all polymorphic variants and the ability to provide clinical benefit in previously unresponsive tumors.,0.01565231612039497,NEUTRAL
We ll also show the benefit of adding      to other checkpoint inhibitors such as anti-PD-   anti-TIGIT  iNKT-activating therapy and adoptive T-cell therapy. Novel IO combinations will drive the next wave of IO therapy and Agenus believe that      alone and in combination with other mechanisms is the foundation of this next wave.,0.08651507741888054,NEUTRAL
Let s turn now for a moment to work on TIGIT. Not unlike CTLA-  and PD-   TIGIT is one of the key components in our immune system  it s found on T cells and by suppressing unnecessary activity like the activation of T cells  it helps keep the immune system properly balanced. Usually TIGIT is invaluable to good health  but in cancer patients TIGIT s suppression of the immune system allows tumors to grow.,0.07039600261487067,NEUTRAL
An important finding is that treatment with PD-  actually upregulates TIGIT consequently curbing the activity of TIGIT often using antibodies has become an area of intense R D efforts and anti-TIGIT therapy is set to be another breakthrough in IO. Agenus has two anti-TIGIT antibodies. This is AGEN     a monospecific antibody that s also engineered like AGEN     to improve performance.,0.043805943394545466,NEUTRAL
And AGEN      a bispecific antibody that includes a TIGIT arm that has also been engineered for Fc enhancement. As a potentially best-in-class agents we re prioritizing AGEN     for advancement into the clinic and expect to begin human studies this year. What makes AGEN     potential best-in-class  Similar to       we ve designed the front end of      for strong receptor binding in this case to TIGIT.,0.03147692600032315,NEUTRAL
We ve also engineered the Fc back-end for improved T cell and NK cell activation in order to more effectively unleash the immune system. We ve gone one step further with      by engineering it as a bispecific antibody  co-targeting a second tumor escape mechanism to create a double blockade against cancer escape. This dual blockade is designed to address a potential alternate escape mechanism to TIGIT therapy.,0.12369535220204853,NEUTRAL
Overall  we believe the combination of our Fc enhanced and co-targeting with our AGEN     bispecific gives it best-in-class potential. And as Garo mentioned  potentially provides strong efficacy not just in combination with other IO mechanisms  but also uniquely as a single agent. Some of this has already been demonstrated in preclinical tumor models and we eagerly anticipate clinical trials initiation this year.,0.32336781854974106,POSITIVE
Our TIGIT strategy was also recently featured in our first episode of Agenus insights. This is our new R D mini-series that provides insight into impactful areas of research and Agenus  contributions to immuno-oncology. We encourage you to watch the replay and stay tuned for more episodes in the coming months.,0.15671981265040813,NEUTRAL
Through our AgenTus subsidiary  we ve developed a platform to produce invariant natural killer T cells or iNKTs. iNKTs are type of self-directed  intelligent immune cells  capable of producing responses from both the innate and the adaptive arms of the immune system.,0.0037898082882747985,NEUTRAL
iNKTs can combat multiple disease threats in an autonomous manner. In inflammatory disorders  iNKTs has helped to restore the balance of the immune system  correcting conditions like the cytokine storm that we see in patients with severe cases of COVID-  .,0.12342785368673503,NEUTRAL
Earlier this year  we announced preliminary Phase   data from our COVID trial currently ongoing. Dose escalation for an initiation into a Phase   trial is on track for the first half of this year and data readouts are expected in the fourth quarter.,0.008760258555412292,NEUTRAL
Now in cancer  iNKTs homing on tissues and direct the killing of tumor cells. They have an invariant TCR receptor. It doesn t need to be engineered to them. This will counter immune suppressor cells and block tumor escape mechanisms.,0.046909213066101074,NEUTRAL
You can imagine the benefit of this homing feature we observe in lung tissue in the infectious disease setting to be very impactful in diseases like lung cancer. And as the cell therapy iNKTs has the potential to be used on their own  and in combination with additional anti-cancer therapies such as those already in our pipeline.,0.12667801161296666,NEUTRAL
AgenTus  first iNKT Phase   trial in cancer is anticipated to start dosing during the first half of this year  and we re targeting human studies to be initiated in solid tumors soon thereafter.,-6.702262908220291e-06,NEUTRAL
And lastly  while we often discuss our IO pipeline compounds in isolation  there s clearly tremendous value in the combination potential for the cancer pathways we re targeting.,0.26121500972658396,POSITIVE
PD-   CTLA-   TIGIT  iNKT therapy and other promising mechanisms and programs we have not yet discussed on this call. Stay tuned for more on these exciting developments in the balance of this year.,0.19704998325323686,NEUTRAL
I ll now turn the call over to our Chief Commercial Officer  Andy Hurley to elaborate on our excitement regarding AGEN    .,0.14617201825603843,NEUTRAL
Andy Hurley,0.0028687235462712124,NEUTRAL
Thank you  Jen. My decision to join the Agenus team was driven by the excitement we all feel and the opportunities we have here under one roof. I m also driven by our near-term prospects  which I believe could create substantial value.,0.46526911163527984,POSITIVE
I m particularly excited by how we can take our PD-  balstilimab  and potentially grow it into a major franchise with a superior combination potential with AGEN    . I believe      will significantly expand the commercial opportunity of our anti-PD-  with the potential to outperform current IO combinations.,0.4735558340762509,POSITIVE
The clinical results to date have been very exciting  both as a monotherapy and in combinations across a wide array of tumor types. Specifically  as Jen said  cold tumors  such as microsatellite stable tumors  represent a significant portion within colorectal and endometrial cancers.,0.28702027862891555,POSITIVE
And traditional PD-  anti-CTLA-  inhibitor therapies have not been as effective here. These are tumors  which don t generally respond to cancer immunotherapy  and yet we are seeing responses with AGEN    .,-0.09399930108338594,NEUTRAL
Practically and conceptually  we re not limited to any tumor type if the current response trends we are seeing continue. It s really a function of picky patients certifications  which can get us to the finish line quickly and leverage this to expand on our broader opportunities.,0.2831140345952008,POSITIVE
Having our own PD-  to pair with our superior CTLA-  and then having our own unique CTLA-   which can add significant value to our PD-   are advantages which are very exciting for us to pursue.,0.4181004316196777,POSITIVE
And then  there s the rest of our pipeline  including our intelligent  cell therapy program  our vaccines and exciting pipeline of antibodies with compelling early data. I feel the privilege of working with an exceptional team of people across all disciplines.,0.3604965473350603,POSITIVE
I have worked at highly successful companies  but what we have here is very unique and exciting. I hope to interact with you more frequently  and do a deeper dive on our commercial strategy to create something exceptional.,0.43838829186279327,POSITIVE

Yeah. Hey  guys. This is Jeet on for Biren. Thanks for taking my questions. Congratulations on the progress to date. I m looking forward to updates this year. Could you just maybe walk me through the timing perhaps between the bal BLA filing  and when you actually anticipate submitting the combo and perhaps when ultimate approval is perhaps expected there  And then second  just if you could talk through perhaps some of your go-to-market efforts to this point and any goals for the remainder of this year  and if there s any color on discussions with payers or thoughts on pricing that would be great. Thank you.,0.2429593075066805,POSITIVE
Garo Armen,-0.023363035870715976,NEUTRAL
Thank you  Biren. Let me start out addressing the bal zal question. As you know and as we sort of alluded to  as data matures  looking at our past performance with data disclosures  we re delighted to see that the data is getting better. And I think given the size of our company and given the enormous demands on us for regulatory undertakings  we ve made a decision several months ago which we articulated to the investment community that our first priority is to file our BLA with balstilimab. And once that s done  we will provide additional guidance for our timelines associated with our bal zal filing. And of course  that will include disclosure of more mature data which we re in the process of addressing both from a public disclosure perspective as well as disclosing it to the agency.,0.17037191265262663,NEUTRAL

Andy Hurley,0.0028687235462712124,NEUTRAL
Sure. Yes  it s a good question. I ve been here in a limited amount of time  but I can tell you that the launch planning is underway. We re really evaluating how we re going to really address the unmet needs in the marketplace and position this product in a way that addresses those unmet needs both at a physician level as well as on a patient level.,0.277019189321436,POSITIVE
At the patient level  you bring up the question on pricing and access  that s going to be one of our absolute paramount priorities is just to ensure unencumbered access to balstilimab  as we look at the landscape that that s going to follow. We look at this as a pivotal part in our relationship with payers because we don t believe this is going to be  of course  our first and only into the marketplace.,0.003202110528945923,NEUTRAL
We want to be able to follow on with other products  and establishing those relationships and making sure that they understand our goals  which is unencumbered patient access is going to be really key. So  we re going to be starting those discussions with payers. We ve done a lot of market research to understand really what are the drivers to position our product  and we re really encouraged by what we re hearing to be able to offer that in a setting both at the physician and patient level.,0.22754066169727594,NEUTRAL

Good morning team. Appreciate the comprehensive update and thanks for taking my questions  and great to have Dr. O Day and Andy be part of the discussion. So maybe just piggybacking on the previous question on the upcoming      clinical data at AACR  would you also have more updated cutoff relative to February    Could you just clarify that  And maybe Dr. O Day if you could comment on why MSS colorectal indication kind of makes the first to pursue as you think about fast  ph  to market  Can you just talk about the dynamics of that indication ,0.4015911358874291,POSITIVE
Jennifer Buell,0.0014714345597894862,NEUTRAL
So  before I turn it over to Dr. O Day  Mayank  thanks for your question. At AACR  yes  we will have a more mature data than what we ve previously disclosed  and this will include more information on duration as well as potential new responses in the program too. Now  I ll turn it over to Dr. O Day to give you his thinking on MSS colorectal cancer.,0.25528024649247527,POSITIVE
Steven O Day,0.002721953234868124,NEUTRAL
Thank you Mayank. Well  as Jenny said  I m new to the company in recent months  but I have had the unique opportunity to be involved with      over the course of the last several years both in learning about its exciting clinical drug design as well as pre-clinical data and then obviously being involved as the principal investigator in the      Phase   trial.,0.46009838706231676,POSITIVE
What s exciting to me is the pre-clinical data of more activity and T-reg depletion  as well as more potential access to low affinity CD   alleles all seems to be playing out so far in the clinic with our Phase I trial.,0.42350969556719065,POSITIVE
As you can imagine  with the competitive nature and approvals across I-O indications in solid tumors  Phase I trials attract fairly cold tumors that are MS-stable and there s no surprise that our trial has attracted those patients  particularly colorectal endometrial MS stable ovarian and others.,-0.026626940816640854,NEUTRAL
And what s exciting to me is to see objective responses  obviously in both      monotherapy in combinations in these cold tumors that are predominantly PD-L  negative MS stable low tumor burden  and interestingly  in CD   lower heterozygous affinity polymorphisms  which is all consistent with preclinical data.,0.2805581968277693,POSITIVE
So given that fact  obviously  I m excited to be part of the development of this drug as we go forward. And colorectal MS stable cohorts are clearly a huge unmet need with a low bar in the second and third-line setting.,0.19955061748623848,MIXED
So  we re going to follow the data and expand these cohorts in cold tumors as well as look at our warm-to-hot tumors  both lung and then cutaneous tumors  melanoma  and non-melanoma cutaneous skin tumors are real opportunities for us to look both at this agent and single agent as well as combination. So  it s going to be exciting coming year for me and my clinical team to develop this very exciting drug.,0.4838316076347837,POSITIVE
Mayank Mamtani,0.001143528614193201,NEUTRAL
Fantastic. That s very helpful. And then on -- two quick ones for Jen  and I have one more for Garo to close. Jen  what would be the path for QS-   just from a clinical development standpoint  And also on the TIGIT bispecific  when do you expect disclosing the other target you re working on ,0.4972163720813114,POSITIVE
Jennifer Buell,0.0014714345597894862,NEUTRAL
So Mayank  I m here. So let me start with TIGIT disclosing. As you can imagine  this is an incredibly competitive space. We have a bispecific that is a first of its kind we believe and it s designed really to address an entirely new area. So we will not be disclosing that anytime soon  but we ll certainly keep you informed as the data continue to progress both preclinically and then clinically and that may drive our decision on disclosures.,0.14728224999271333,NEUTRAL
For QS-    the development is really straightforward. So as you know  Bill   Melinda Gates Foundation had invested in our initiative to advance a sustainable supply of QS-  . We ve done so we re in the process of doing so  but we ve already generated early data and demonstrated the bio-comparability of this new supply compared to the previous clinic version  which is now in the approved Shingrix vaccine as you know.,0.2763389184838161,POSITIVE
So the development is straightforward. It s preclinical comparability. And then the clinical program will be very abbreviated to bring this product into market with a number of vaccine products underway. And particularly  at this time when we see the criticality of effective vaccines  we know that historical vaccines no longer cut it. Flu vaccines at     efficacy just won t do it. So we need to improve our ability to take antigens allow for mass global production of those and this is where QS-   is really critical at antigen sparing allowing a fewer number or lower amount of antigens to actually be quite effective. As you see with Shingrix  it s over      up to     effective in adults and gets better with age. These are the kinds of findings that we re going to need across the board as we deal with these mutating viruses repeatedly.,-0.18353062868118286,NEUTRAL
Mayank Mamtani,0.001143528614193201,NEUTRAL
Okay. Very helpful. So I think a number of different disease indications that you may consider including flu  including COVID  even Shingrix. Understood. Then  last for Garo  as you think about the cash accretive transactions  just can you just high level talk to the framework that you guys are kind of evaluating internally. When you think about prosecuting these opportunities across the board more advanced late-stage versus earlier stage programs  Kind of  how do you think about a lot of push and pull that might be associated with these transactions ,0.05887800455093384,NEUTRAL
Garo Armen,-0.023363035870715976,NEUTRAL
Right. So all I can tell you right now is  stay tuned. As I said  in the second quarter  starting in the second quarter  we will see cash-accretive transactions including corporate transactions. So unfortunately  I cannot disclose anything more than that right now.,-0.3651132225058973,NEGATIVE

Thank you  Christian. Good afternoon  everyone. Welcome to Alta s fourth quarter and full year      earnings conference call. On the call with us today are Ryan Greenawalt  our Chairman and CEO  and Tony Colucci  our Chief Financial Officer. For today s call management will first provide a review of the fourth quarter and the full year financial results. And then we will conduct a Q A session. We will begin with some prepared remarks before we open the call for your question.,0.41809626956819557,POSITIVE

Thank you  Sinem and welcome  everyone. Thank you for joining Alta Equipment Group s fourth quarter      earnings call. Our strong performance and solid financial results in the fourth quarter capped off a transformative and very successful      despite the significant impact of the COVID pandemic. We achieved several important accomplishments which I ll briefly touch on before turning the call over to Tony for a financial review of the fourth quarter and full year.,0.48601661817519926,POSITIVE
The operating environment for our services continued to improve from the prior quarter as customer demand increased consecutively each month in the fourth quarter. Labor productivity  which is the heartbeat of our operations increased to benchmark levels before the end of the year. In response to increased sales activity and demand for labor hours  we added to our product support workforce both  organically and through acquisitions and ended the year with over     skilled technicians  an increase of approximately     technicians year-over-year  and representing roughly half of our total headcount. Our entire Alta team once again rose to the occasion during these difficult times demonstrating incredible dedication and delivered on our commitment to exceptional service and equipment uptime. A sincere thank you to all of our employees who make Alta the great company it is today.,0.18730400130152702,NEUTRAL
And touching on our financial highlights  fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA came in at    .  million on revenue of     .  million. We reached a true milestone in delivering over    billion in revenue on a pro forma basis with adjusted pro forma EBITDA of    .  million for the year. Our liquidity position remains strong and our balance sheet flexible in providing the support needed to execute our organic and acquisition growth strategy. And looking at the full year  we overcame many challenges that we faced due to the COVID pandemic and navigated the business through unprecedented shutdowns. We were designated as an essential business and remain fully operational at all of our    branches across    states. Our variable cost structure and the dexterity of our business model allows management to swiftly implement cost reduction measures to efficiently manage the business and sustain positive adjusted EBITDA and mitigate against margin declines. The revenue decline was less than anticipated and business activity began to pick up from the April trough through the end of the year.,0.09336744688334875,NEUTRAL
As we move through the recovery in the second half of the year  we reduced some of the cost mitigation measures and began calling back skilled technicians who were furloughed as big business activity returned to pre-COVID levels. The diversity of both  our geographies and our end-markets enabled us to weather the pandemic storm. Also as a reflection of our business model  our product support revenue remained strong during this period and grew     in       compared to the prior year when including our required revenues. In      consistent with our acquisition strategy  we expanded our geographic footprint  established relationships with new OEM partners  and further diversified our end-market reach. In the fourth quarter  we completed two accretive acquisitions that increased our scale and strengthened our business profile. We acquired the construction dealership assets of Vantage Equipment which operates three branches in the northern region of New York State. Alta is now the authorized distributor of Volvo products in most of New York State  a region that offers significant additional expansion opportunities. Vantage also diversifies our customer base and serves as a great complement to our Lifttech business which serves the New York material handling market. This combination is powerful and allows us to bring our full resources to this large and growing market.,0.06940131890587509,NEUTRAL
As we mentioned on our third quarter earnings call  we closed the Howell Tractor and Equipment acquisitions in late October. Howell serves the Northern Illinois and Northwest Indiana construction markets with a wide range of construction and crane equipment. Howell enjoys a strong relationship with leading manufacturers such as Sennebogen  which is a new addition to Alta s product line in the region.,0.07310528648667969,NEUTRAL
Looking at the full year  we completed seven acquisitions which in total contributed approximately     million to adjusted EBITDA in       our most active year on the M A front. Alta has become the partner of choice in the fragmented equipment dealer market as we provide manufacturers the benefit of our scale  liquidity and reputation to facilitate share growth and customer loyalty. The structural supply demand and balance between buyers and sellers in our industry remains intact and we continue to execute on our growth strategy.,0.0991332595658605,NEUTRAL
As we noted in today s news release  we ve rebranded our Industrial Segments and Material Handling. Material Handling is the recognized industry vernacular and better describes the range of our capabilities. The rebranding will have particular significance of messaging to the e-commerce sector which values the integration of Material Handling equipment with the more sophisticated systems offerings. PeakLogix  a national material handling systems integrator we acquired in mid-year has significantly enhanced our positioning in this area and provides us with a competitive advantage in the fast growing  warehousing and logistics market  which has only continued to pick up steam as the recovery continuous. Peak offers a complete material management solution and delivers efficiency and increased productivity for it s customers. We ve been able to cross-sell and promote their services across our entire material handling customer base  and integrate them with our other warehouse automation solutions.,0.17109084287949372,NEUTRAL
We also expanded our full service capabilities in this area  more recently with a small but strategic acquisition in ScottTech  which provides warehouse control software and systems. It is important to highlight that these new systems integration services are unconstrained by our dealership territories and both acquired businesses have customers throughout the U.S. and internationally.,0.02343058752012439,NEUTRAL
And looking forward we see a clear path to a full recovery as the recovery takes hold and the year progresses. The investments we ve made in technology products and people position us well to continue our strong performance entering     . We re encouraged by the positive trends we re seeing  especially by the strong secular tailwinds that are apparent in our material handling and construction segments. E-commerce growth is driving higher volumes from large retailers who warehouse their products which increases our opportunity to expand and lean into this area of the business. The demand for automation and more complex systems and technology in warehousing and material handling has never been greater  and we believe it is in the early stages. There is clearly upside from potential federal stimulus and pent-up demand for capital projects to improve our net -- our aging national infrastructure. Alta s strong relationships with leading OEMs and our recent geographic market expansion position us to be a great partner for both  material handling and construction equipment markets.,0.1784215250663692,NEUTRAL
This was truly a transformative year by any measure  we believe our strong financial results in our first year as a public company demonstrate the outstanding execution of our resilient dealership model and our operational discipline through a difficult and unprecedented time. We are exciting -- excited and increasingly confident in our ability to deliver increased financial results and enhanced shareholder value moving forward. I d like to thank our manufacturing partners for their support  our dedicated employees for their hard work  and our shareholders for their support and confidence in the company.,0.4784994055844436,POSITIVE

My remarks today will focus on four key areas  first  I ll be presenting our fourth quarter performance  which we are pleased with. As the business continues to close in the COVID gap and gain ground year-over-year on some key metrics. I ll be focusing in on specific departmental revenue figures  organic cash flows and rental fleet fluctuations  and outperformance on these metrics impacted the balance sheet and our leverage profile in a positive way. Second  I ll be discussing our full year      performance and sequential quarter-over-quarter trends in two of our key performance indicators. Specifically  I ll discuss how those KPI trends correlated to EBITDA performance for the year  and how those      trends compared to       a year reflective of a more typical business climate. Third  I want to touch on year-end acquisition of Vantage Equipment  how we thought about the return profile of our investment when compared to the cost of capital associated with the preferred stock we raised to fund the transaction. I also want to provide some high level financial figures on the ScottTech acquisition that we closed at the beginning of this month. Lastly  I ll discuss the balance sheet  and in particular  our leverage and liquidity position as we entered     .,0.057573709258576855,NEUTRAL

For the quarter  the company recorded revenue of      million  which is a record sales number for Alta. I ll get into what drove that figure to such a high level in a moment but the      million represents a     million sequential increase over Q  and a  .   increase on an organic basis versus Q      . From an EBITDA perspective  we realized    .  million in adjusted EBITDA for the quarter  up from    .  million in the third quarter of     . Importantly  our adjusted pro forma EBITDA for Q   which assumes we had owned Vantage and Howell for the entire quarter was    .  million  or   .  million less than Q  of     . I ll come back to that   .  million EBITDA variance a little later in my comments.,0.024581336649134755,NEUTRAL
Next  I d like to talk about organic cash flows in the fourth quarter. First  I mentioned the      million in revenue a moment ago  and how that was a record sales number for the business. Just to focus in on that briefly  on previous calls I mentioned how the fourth quarter is typically the largest equipment sales quarter of the year for Alta  and in particular  it s historically been our largest rental equipment sales quarter of the year. Really in a bit further  new and used equipment sales were      million for the quarter  a     million increase over Q   another record number. But importantly  we recorded an additional     million of rental equipment sales for the quarter  a number that is two times the amount sold in Q      .,0.012554874643683434,NEUTRAL
The reason why I focused on the     million rental disposal number is because it led to a net decrease of    .  million in rental fleet  which when coupled with our EBITDA for the quarter led to an organic delivering of approximately     million  and an unlevered free cash flow conversion on EBITDA factor of over      for Q      . We believe this organic delevering to be a powerful indication on the marketability of our rental fleet assets and our ability to generate cash flow and liquidity by optimizing our rental fleet in a short period of time. On an organic basis  we believe this to be the story of the quarter.,0.05687237996608019,NEUTRAL
Few other P L highlights before I move on. And just to jump back to the equipment sales number in Q  just for a second  let s keep in mind our razor and blade business model. The      million in equipment sales for the quarter is now customer field population which bodes well for the future of our high margin product support departments. Another encouraging metric from the P L  we saw a   .  million rental revenue increase over Q       on an organic basis  an indication of continued strengthening in our rental business. And importantly  continued year-over-year organic growth in our parts and service departments in our construction segment.,0.21969013032503426,NEUTRAL
Moving on to the second key area of my prepared remarks. I d like to focus on some high level pro forma numbers for the full year      and certain quarter-over-quarter trends in key performance indicators we observed throughout the year. First  for the fiscal year       as Ryan mentioned  on a pro forma basis our annual revenue is now slightly above the    billion mark. And on an adjusted pro forma basis  our EBITDA as of the year -- as of year-end was nearly      million. A few key points and trends to point out is we do a look back on       and I d like to refer everyone to Slide    of our earnings presentation which depicts the data I ll be referring to.,0.0420983973890543,NEUTRAL
First  as we ve discussed on previous calls  two major drivers of EBITDA cash flows in our business correlate to two key performance indicators we track  labor productivity and rental fleet utilization. Of note and discussed on prior calls  we saw the bottom in labor productivity in Q       began to recover on the metric in Q   and I m happy to report that we were able to achieve pre-COVID labor productivity levels in Q   that trend has continued as we moved into Q . So for labor productivity  a V-shaped recovery to be sure  and with positive trends headed into     .,0.18455363053362817,NEUTRAL
Second  rental utilization which I -- which as I have mentioned previously  has lagged historic levels realized in our business. And as you will note on slide     our physical utilization variants versus the prior years followed a similar trend that labor productivity followed in     . We began to see the follow-up towards the end of Q   the year-on-year variance was most acute in Q   we started recovering in Q   and continued to close the gap in Q . Now  unlike labor productivity  as of the end of the year  we have yet to fully close the gap on rental utilization. Having said that  and importantly  the early signs in Q  are encouraging and suggest a continued closing of the gap.,-0.08720753714442253,NEUTRAL
So  in summary  as we looked at these two key KPIs and how they trended throughout       and we correlate them against our EBITDA performance throughout the year  we noticed similar trend in terms of the gap versus historic norms. Again  referring to slide    you will note that our year-on-year EBITDA performance mimics the trends observed in the two KPIs. In summary  of the    .  million in EBITDA variance for the year  approximately     was incurred in Q  and Q . Importantly  as with both the KPIs  we continue to narrow the year-on-year EBITDA gap here in Q  with the gap being   .  million on a pro forma basis for the quarter versus a   .  million gap in Q      .,0.011709796264767647,NEUTRAL
Last item of note in this section of my commentary  the turbulence of      disguised a typical seasonality in our business  and in particular  the seasonality of our EBITDA. In the EBITDA look-back chart on slide     you will note that almost     of our pro forma      EBITDA more typically and expectedly given our construction  Technical Difficulty  annual EBITDA  Q  and Q  delivered     and     each  and  Technical Difficulty  the macro backdrop  Technical Difficulty .,-0.010087819769978523,NEUTRAL
For the third area of my prepared remarks  I d like to briefly touch on our recent M A activity in the preferred stock offering we contemplated  Technical Difficulty . For the year  we completed our acquisition of Vantage at an additional     million of revenue. The acquisition further expands our territorial reach with Volvo and provides for natural synergies with Lifttech  our material handling operation in upstate New York. At a total enterprise value of about     million  we believe the deal to be accretive from an EBITDA multiple standpoint  as well as in comparison to the cost of capital we sourced to fund the transaction  which was the preferred stock offering we completed in concert with the acquisition.,0.06574898592953105,NEUTRAL
With approximately    technicians serving a market territory known to be greater in size in our established Michigan territory  where we staff more than     technicians  we see -- we see a tremendous aftermarket opportunity and expect to double the size of that business overtime  thereby furthering the accretion over the cost of capital used to fund the deal.,0.07849948457442224,NEUTRAL
Onto ScottTech  on March    we completed the acquisition of ScottTech Integrated Solution as a complement to our PeakLogix acquisition completed in the middle of     . Specializing a warehouse management software and systems integration  we believe the combination of PeakLogix and ScottTech further expands our full solution product offerings and increases our commitment to the emerging technology space. At a purchase price of approximately   .  million  the acquisition adds approximately     million of revenue in close to a    million of annual EBITDA to the enterprise.,0.03866135669522919,NEUTRAL
For the last part of my prepared remarks  I want to give a quick update on the balance sheet and our credit profile at the end of Q . Two key factors here to discuss  leverage and liquidity. First  leverage. I mentioned early in the call  we realized an organic de-leveraging in the business by virtue of our big quarter in rental equipment sales. That factor alongside solid EBITDA performance in the quarter and the use of the preferred stock offering to fund advantage acquisition all led to total leverage reducing from about  . x EBITDA in Q  to  . x at year end  which with senior leverage dropping to  . x  with both leverage ratios being well inside our leverage covenants.,0.014430685492698103,NEUTRAL
Touching on liquidity. And we feel really good about our position here. Recall that we closed the IPO with roughly      million in cash and revolving liquidity. Since the IPO in mid-February  we ve acquired five  and now at six strategic business funding growth CapEx in our rental fleets  specifically in an emerging market like Florida  in service the cash cost of our debt. As of the end of Q   I m happy to report  the business held the same level of liquidity that it had at the IPO or approximately      million. We believe holding liquidity at these levels  given all the challenges and activity that      presented to be an impressive result  a reflection of our cash flow profile and a strong collateral base  which we use to fund important strategic investments. This is also a testament to how we thoughtfully positioned our capital structure and how we fund M A.,0.2959108375944197,POSITIVE

A couple of quick questions. Your adjusted EBITDA margins today are around    . Can you talk about some of the drivers to margin expansion in      and beyond ,0.024441455956548452,NEUTRAL
Tony Colucci,0.0006809440237702802,NEUTRAL
Sure  Alex. When we look back at the fourth quarter there  I ve made special note in my comments about the large amount of rental equipment sales. And so for the quarter  it s going to feel like  it s going to look like that our EBITDA margins were depressed  but it really was a function of all of the equipment sales and to refer back to the razor and the blades concept that s inherent in our business model. As you know  razors don t have as good of margin as the blades and so that that mix got thrown out of whack there in the fourth quarter. As we drive forward here  obviously the business model is to continue to grow  feel the  ph  population  build the product support business  which is higher margin in the future. So we would think that the mix  as we continue to move along  won t be the same as it was in the fourth quarter and shift more kind of appropriately back toward a more regular mix of parts and service  thereby kind of driving that EBITDA margin a little bit further north in the future. When we think about rental  EBITDA margins on rental are very high as well. We had some positive news there and it continue to trend in the appropriate direction. So  so long as rental continues to trend  that will also drive the EBITDA margin higher.,-0.22809555009007454,NEGATIVE

Sure  Alex. This is Ryan. So a couple areas that are rebounding faster at our home turf is the automotive industry in our home state of Michigan. And then throughout our material handling dealership footprint  anything related to the warehousing market has remained steady and is accelerating.

Ryan Greenawalt,-5.506275920197368e-05,NEUTRAL
Sure. We think about the first leg being territorial expansion with our two most significant OEM partners. And those opportunities  we re always watching for  but there has to be a catalyst  some kind of succession planning issue or a catalyst  a reason for one of the ownership groups to be looking for an exit. What we have a lot of  is infill opportunities  which there were several examples of that last year. As we as we look to some of these markets where we re less mature or the new entrants and taking over territories where we can grow share  we ll be looking to build the product portfolio and there could certainly be an M A component of that talking in smaller dealerships in our existing footprint. And in terms of the third segment  as we mentioned on the last call  we re very focused on kind of watching the evolution of transportation  the electrification of the over the road fleet. Over the road  the truck segment is something that we d like to be in long term. And as the business evolves  we think that we re really well-positioned with our experience in both electric  on the battery side and the fuel cell side from our material handling business. So those are conversations that we re open to. It s sort of very active time. A lot of new companies coming to market and that we do envision something long term in that sector.,0.023219007067382336,NEUTRAL

Ryan Greenawalt,-5.506275920197368e-05,NEUTRAL
Oh  yes  by in large Mike  it was the equipment sales as I mentioned. Rental equipment sales. As customers  we get toward year end  customers have capital budgets that maybe they re looking to get rid of for the year  if you will. We also have customers that have historically looked to take advantage of bonus depreciation from a tax perspective. And so  the fourth quarter is usually overweight equipment sales and it was again this year  probably more than we expected. But that equipment sales number is what s driving a lot of the organic growth. We did have organic growth  as we mentioned in the rental line in parts and service and construction as well.

Tony Colucci,0.0006809440237702802,NEUTRAL
Yes  Mike  this is Tony. I ll take that one. So  when we think about rental  we re thinking always about utilization and cash flows off of it. Not necessarily gross margin  because there s so much depreciation in there. But as we move through Q  and Q   we had already kind of committed to making some investments down in Florida  with the Flagler acquisition and adding rental fleet down there. We think long term that it s still the right thing to do. And what we did here in the fourth quarter was kind of optimize a little bit. I mentioned the reduction of about     million in organic kind of acquisition costs here. As we left the year end as you ll see  in our numbers  we got roughly a      million fleet headed into     . We feel good about that fleet level. It may ebb and flow. If we have a      million fleet  you ll see in our numbers we turned over almost a quarter of that fleet in the year  which is part of our business model is that rent-to-sell  ph  with the heavy equipment to get it out in the field population. So at any rate  the fleet may ebb and flow a little bit  but by in large  the expectation here is that we re going to keep the fleet kind of in that same level  let the market kind of decide demand to see if we re going to expand  or if we have to pair back some more. But we don t at this point have expectation of growing the fleet in any material way.,0.18747368082404137,POSITIVE

Great. And then one last one from me. The EBITDA that we saw in Q  and the exit rate for the year  is that a good sort of baseline minimum for the full year  adding in perhaps maybe    million to     million for the last two deals a bit in the fourth quarter  And from there  do you have any sense as to what you might get from close  ph  perspective in      ,0.020974352955818176,MIXED
Tony Colucci,0.0006809440237702802,NEUTRAL
Yes. Good question  Mike. The number that I would refer you to in the fourth quarter as kind of a good metric to maybe build off as we move along here is the    .  million of pro forma EBITDA for the fourth quarter. I made special mention of kind of the seasonality here as we as we go along and how that seasonality kind of gets flipped around a little bit in     . But  I think that fourth quarter numbers are a good one to build off of. Relative to organic growth we have the coming off of       we would we would expect some. We re impacted by COVID  so we certainly think we ll be jumping off of      levels.

And it gets a little foggy with given COVID and the furloughs and so on and so forth. The one metric that we are kind of pointing to is we ve talked a lot about the aftermarket opportunity we saw down at Flagler in Florida. When we took that dealership over  they had    technicians. I think we closed the year with    technicians on staff down there. So growing in all the right areas where there s a lot of opportunity.

Yes. I think the way that I would answer that  Matt  is if had      of rental fleet  kind of on the hand acquisition costs  in a more normal situation  we might have     or     of that out on rent. The variance that we saw and the shocks that we saw was something like take     off of that figure. So the     becomes      if you will  and then you can kind of extrapolate that into our business. You can kind of see what happens to EBITDA so on and so forth thereafter. But again  rough math that s kind of what we saw. And it was in the pockets of the fleet. Our material handling fleet didn t see as big of a shock that our construction fleet did in Q  and Q .

Thank you  Kettina  and thank you  everybody  for attending today. After several years of detailed work and lots of successful exploration  last year  we completed the Keno Hill silver district permitting process and began moving the district back into mining operations.      was pivotal for the company and certainly a challenging year to move a mine into production. For sure  more than one person has commented to me that making a decision to move to production in the middle of a pandemic might have been a dubious decision. We certainly misread the severity of the second wave in Q  as borders locked down and isolation requirements were reinstituted. But thanks to the professional and determined attributes of our workforce and response and support from YG  from the Yukon government  we have been successfully navigating the restrictions posed by the COVID-   pandemic. Our progress is slowed. There are certainly added costs  but we are most definitely moving forward towards establishing ourselves as the only primary Canadian silver miner.,0.16403242386877537,MIXED
I should start by summarizing our achievements in      before discussing our outlook for      and our expectation for Keno Hill s longer-term future. On the operations front  in February  we sold our environmental business  AEG  to the AEG management for a total consideration of    .  million. This allowed us to focus all of our resources to our mining business.,0.24749548218096606,NEUTRAL
In June  following the receipt of the draft water license  we announced our decision to move Keno Hill to production by restarting mining operations at the Bellekeno mine and advancing the Flame   Moth and Bermingham deposits into development and ultimately operation. By August  we were hard on the recruiting trail and scaling up our surface facilities. And in October  we started drilling and blasting underground ore at Bellekeno. All of our production at Bellekeno is long hole in all blocks which had previously been overcut and undercut. Ore from Bellekeno was stockpiled and used for the initial mill commissioning in Q      .,-0.08125503361225128,NEUTRAL
And just anecdotally  that s why silver grades have certainly exceeded the mine s ore  old   ph  block model grades. And we expect the Bellekeno underground mining operations will extend into Q        longer than initially anticipated.,-0.041397083550691605,NEUTRAL
Underground development at Bermingham and Flame   Moth started in Q        and production at Bermingham is scheduled to start in Q        following completion of the new prime re-ventilation raise  which is about     complete as we speak.,0.016336099070031196,NEUTRAL
In Q   we were faced with the additional COVID-   restrictions. And as I previously mentioned  this affected our hiring program. And that  along with slower commissioning of new underground equipment  led us to a decision to temporarily suspend underground work at Flame   Moth and focus all of our efforts  at least temporarily  at Bermingham  along with continuing ore production from Bellekeno  of course.,-0.03581613767892122,NEUTRAL
In the district mill  modifications completed in Q       included the installation of cyclones  a new filter press and modifications to the final feeder. We undertook the initial commissioning runs at the mill in November and processed about     tonnes of Bellekeno ore  producing our first concentrate.,0.005211506533669308,NEUTRAL
Staying with the mill  construction of a new building around the crusher was completed in Q        and the installation of a new ventilation system in the crushing facility is scheduled for completion in Q      . The mill continues to operate on a   and   basis as other mechanical adjustments and circuit modifications mainly focused on metallurgical performance are ongoing and continued during this mill commissioning stage. Through the end of February       we have produced a total of more than       tonnes of ore from Bellekeno with silver head grades and recoveries of     grams per tonne silver and      respectively. Both of these are above plan. The first lead-silver concentrate and zinc concentrate shipments were dispatched in January     .,0.03609506646171212,NEUTRAL
Since the beginning of the COVID-   pandemic  we have maintained strict health and safety and social distancing measures and kept our workforce and our community safe. However  as I previously mentioned  the effects of these measures on workforce schedules  recruitment  onboarding and training  especially our new underground equipment  has been slowed by both the COVID-related restrictions and the variable ground conditions primarily attributable to innovated quartzite and schist  which the operator is a steadily gaining experience. We expect that as COVID-   restrictions ease over the coming months  we ll see further operational improvements.,0.017184138298034668,NEUTRAL
On the exploration front. Our      surface exploration program confirmed the presence of high-grade silver mineralization first discovered in      below the existing Bermingham deposit. Last year s drilling focused on a structurally controlled sub-horizontal mineralized zone  which has traced over     meters along strike and a series of wide step-outs  which results generally in the  - to   -meter true thickness range in terms of the mineralization  which generally contain between       and more than       grams per tonne silver.,0.00621963304001838,NEUTRAL
In total  we completed       meters focused along the structurally controlled sub-horizontal zone. And this year  beginning -- as we speak here  we re anticipating about        meters of directionally controlled drilling to infill the work done in     .,0.018146183341741562,NEUTRAL
Finally  in       ERDC advanced the reclamation project to offset historic liabilities in the district. And in July of       the YESAB environmental and socioeconomic assessment board has issued a final decision document on the final valuation report. And ERDC has now entered into the Water Boards -- Yukon Water Boards licensing process to obtain the final water license to authorize the activities necessary to begin the closure of the district s historic liabilities. After licensing  the reclamation plan will be finalized for submission to the Crown-Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs Canada for approval prior to execution of the final reclamation plan.,0.0073677517648320645,NEUTRAL
On the financial and corporate front  and just to quickly run through some of the metrics in our filings yesterday. For the year ended December           we reported an operating loss of    .  million  much of which is due to increased mine-related expense at Bellekeno and upgrades elsewhere in preparation for the commissioning and start-up activity. We finished      with cash and cash equivalents of    .  million and net working capital of    .  million. We also ended      with   .  million in restricted cash and deposits related to our surety bond.,-0.1087618600577116,NEUTRAL
Finally  during       we completed   equity financings for a total of    .  million  which  of course  were largely directed to start-up -- which are largely being directed to start-up activity. More recently and subsequent to year-end       we sold our NSR royalty in Golden Predator s Brewery Creek project for   .  million in cash. And on January           we issued  .  million shares and completed an equity financing for total gross proceeds of    .  million  the majority of which will fund our large exploration program this year.,0.042162942118011415,NEUTRAL
In       we re focused on ramping up to design throughput of     tonnes per day through the mill. Thus far  we have been operating the mill on a modified schedule to match ore delivery from Bellekeno and to optimize metallurgical performance of our improved flow sheet  including the modified grinding  classifying and filter circuits.,0.0612763132667169,NEUTRAL
With the ore mill feed transitioning to Bermingham sourced ore in Q        ore production at Flame   Moth beginning in Q       and provided that we re not required to further expand our current COVID-   protocols  we are cheered to expect nameplate capacity of     tonnes per day through the mill in Q  of this year. I would say quite confidently that our primary risk in this commissioning and scale-up process is still the COVID risk  meaning that further border and or site restrictions resulting from any resurgence of the virus will be increasingly difficult for us to handle.,-0.013301927596330643,NEUTRAL
At the same time  we re working on an updated technical report for an updated mineral resource and reserve estimate that we expect to release in Q      . This report will incorporate a modified mine plan based on our operational experience to date as well as meaningfully improved silver prices since we published our last mine plan in early     .,0.014914111990947276,NEUTRAL
Finally and just to reiterate  we are mobilizing our exploration team as we speak  planning to begin immediately to drill off the Bermingham Northeast deep mineralization. We ll be utilizing   drill rigs with directional drilling technology to focus on infill drilling and extension of mineralization with the intention to upgrade the Bermingham mineral resource estimate towards year-end when exploration results will be available.,0.034338115132413805,NEUTRAL
The restart of operations at Keno Hill has coincided with strong silver prices and puts us in a good position to take advantage of the opportunities existing in our historic silver-rich district and to generate value for our shareholders. We intend to do this by maximizing all of our existing resources  maintaining a laser-like focus on commissioning and scale-up activities to achieve design throughput and a   million-ounce per year silver run rate while also executing perhaps the most important exploration program we have ever conducted.,0.2655997195688542,POSITIVE
I look forward to keeping you updated on our progress as we get closer to commercial production  and I thank our shareholders for their continued support and confidence in our team.,0.4956305589676049,POSITIVE
Finally  I want to reiterate that we owe a debt of thanks to our employees who have soldiered on through pretty rigorous COVID-related operating protocols and also to the Yukon government and health officials who have worked hand-in-hand with us to ensure that we can continue to operate through this challenging period.,0.08637537434697151,NEUTRAL

Clynton Nauman,0.0001911757281050086,NEUTRAL
Yes. Good morning Jake  and thanks for the question. Yes  we re carrying a certain block -- we carry a block model at Bellekeno. It just happens that there s   primary stopes that are being mined there over the course of the next couple of months -- will be completed in the next couple of months. Certainly  the first one has overachieved its block model grades  and that would not be unexpected in a deposit the style of Bellekeno. We re working pretty centrally located in the deposit. The second stope  you will have to wait until we get it through the mill to see what the grades might be. But yes  I mean  Bellekeno is going to overachieve both in terms of -- relative to the block model in terms of grade and probably tonnes. We ll see.,0.17023970931768417,POSITIVE
Jacob Sekelsky,0.00035639642737805843,NEUTRAL
Okay. That s helpful. And then just on exploration. Obviously  it s a big focus this year with the       -meter program in the Bermingham resource update that you mentioned later this year. How should we be thinking about that updated resource relative to the existing mine plan  I mean do you think we could see an updated mine plan sometime next year after that resource is out ,0.11887415684759617,NEUTRAL
Clynton Nauman,0.0001911757281050086,NEUTRAL
Yes. That s a decision that we re going to have to discuss at Alexco  obviously. I d rather -- I think we d rather sort of wait and take this step by step. Let s get this drilling done and the resource  assuming that the drilling is successful  get any resource put together in that deeper area. And then we ll decide whether or not we should modify mine plan  which is already being modified  as I mentioned  at Bermingham to see whether or not we can accommodate any additional resources should there be any  at depth   ph .,-0.0056264977902174,NEUTRAL
So yes  it s a good question. We have not made that decision yet. But I would expect that if the drilling is successful  I mean  we ll be pretty keen to try and figure out what value would be added by incorporation of that additional mineralization.,0.13110951520502567,NEUTRAL

Joseph Reagor,0.002094988216413185,NEUTRAL
I guess first thing  given the impacts of COVID and a little bit of delays there  what should we think about as far as staging of production over the remainder of the year  Is there kind of a range you can give us of what tonnes per day might look like on a quarterly basis ,0.014003820717334747,NEUTRAL
Clynton Nauman,0.0001911757281050086,NEUTRAL
I mean Brad might want to chime in here but  I mean  generally  Joe  we re thinking that we re going through this commissioning process  we definitely need to onboard more plant-related or mill-related people and to spool that mill up to a more consistent operating basis. I mean right now it s operating on a   and   basis. So we -- I mean we would -- I think we d be reluctant to put specific tonnes and grade in the commissioning process other than our target  which is to achieve     tonnes through the mill in Q  -- in Q   sorry  of this year. I mean  Brad  do you have anything you want to add to that ,-0.1245932299643755,NEUTRAL
Bradley Thrall,0.008154942188411951,NEUTRAL
No. I think you did -- again  in general  there s -- we have a reasonably sized inventory of ore at Bellekeno. And then as Bermingham -- we re projected to hit our first ore horizon at Bermingham in Q . And then you start to combine those together and then Flame   Moth a little bit later on. So yes  it s a gradual ramp-up period. We re continuing to kind of update our schedules and mine plans as we go along here. So I think that s the best we can see it for the moment.,0.09323015622794628,NEUTRAL
Joseph Reagor,0.002094988216413185,NEUTRAL
Okay. Fair enough. On the note of the ramp-up  is there a certain tonnes-per-day average you need to get to in order to start treating the production as revenue instead of an offset to CapEx ,-0.3625731482170522,NEGATIVE
Clynton Nauman,0.0001911757281050086,NEUTRAL
I m going to ask Mike Clark to chime in on that because I think we are early adopting -- the plan is to early adopt the commercial production  whatever you call it  language. Mike  can you ,0.018048813566565514,NEUTRAL
Michael Clark,0.00016289547784253955,NEUTRAL
Yes. Thanks  Clynt. Joe  yes  we are planning to early adopt  which means we ll start recognizing revenues immediately and cost of sales. And so starting in January       all the revenues from Bellekeno we ll be recognizing. And then as Bermingham starts up in Q   followed by Flame in Q   you re going to start seeing all that revenue hit the P L immediately with these -- so we won t be offsetting the mineral properties for revenues. Does that answer your question ,0.1846245126798749,NEUTRAL
Joseph Reagor,0.002094988216413185,NEUTRAL
Okay. Yes  that makes it a lot easier  too. All right. And then last thing  remaining capital spend between now and reaching that     tonnes per day  what s it kind of look like ,0.10755312442779541,MIXED

Bradley Thrall,0.008154942188411951,NEUTRAL
Yes  well  there s a couple of different buckets of capital  Joe. I mean we ve got our PP E capital just to finish up most of -- a few of these capital projects  the second grinding mill  a couple of concentrate regrind mills. So I would put that in a bucket of PP E capital. And that s a relatively modest number    .  million to    million  to finish up those projects. But then you obviously have the working capital to continue to -- as we continue to ramp up and reach kind of steady state and positive revenue  I mean  that s a period as well.,0.06934166233986616,NEUTRAL
So I don t want to put a number on that one yet. Again  similar to your previous question  I think we re kind of continuing to undergo our -- kind of our updated  I guess  mine plans. But again  the PP E capital is relatively low  but it s the working capital until we get to that positive -- to that point where it s cash flow positive  which is into that Q  range with all   mines running.,-0.07403336092829704,NEUTRAL

Bradley Thrall,0.008154942188411951,NEUTRAL
Yes. Hi  Mike. Yes  I mean I think in general  the Yukon -- I mean where the Yukon sits today  there does continue to be a -- the borders are closed. So anybody that comes into the Yukon  even if you re a Yukon resident  you do have to quarantine for    days. To date  there s been    cases of COVID in the Yukon. There s no -- currently no active cases. There hasn t been a reported case at any of the three mines  as you know  between Alexco  those   other operating mines in the Yukon. There hasn t been a reported case at all   of those. And the Yukon is doing pretty well on their vaccination rates. I believe they are leading Canada in terms of the percent of the population.,-0.11633070558309555,NEUTRAL
So yes  all in all  I mean  it s -- there haven t been significant outbreaks. But having said that  yes  I would characterize the approach by the government and health officials as being very cautious  conservative. And I don t believe we ll see much movement in the Yukon  certainly until some significant changes across Canada in order to kind of open up travel again.,0.008532852865755558,MIXED
Mike Niehueser,0.0002472964843036607,NEUTRAL
Well  it sounds like everybody is being extra careful  and that s good. Brad  this is probably for you. Clynt mentioned in the press release the word variable ground conditions. And I was just wondering if that was something new at Bermingham or Flame   Moth compared to what s happened at Bellekeno or maybe the historic  indiscernible .,0.17995893955230713,POSITIVE
Bradley Thrall,0.008154942188411951,NEUTRAL
No. I mean I think -- I mean  as you know  I mean  Keno Hill is  I guess  somewhat known for its variable ground. In the development period we re in right now  we go in and out of a quartzite unit into more of a schistiless component unit and back into quartzite. And we -- during that same time period  we ve got new miners that we re bringing on and training.,-0.05624912679195404,NEUTRAL
And so it s a process of becoming more experienced with that type of ground. It s very similar to what we experienced at Bellekeno  but that was   to    years ago now. So it is somewhat of a kind of a new learning curve  if you will  between -- across the board on operators and equipment and those types of things. So nothing to be -- that s a surprise to us  and we continue to manage and improve on it.,0.25171219068579376,POSITIVE

Well  it sounds like you re being careful and deliberate. As far as exploration go  what s the budget for that                meters at Bermingham Northeast Deep  And is it all going to be infill there  Or is there going to be some expansion deeper or stepping out ,-0.4374629412777722,NEGATIVE
Clynton Nauman,0.0001911757281050086,NEUTRAL
Yes. I mean we ll probably spend somewhere between    million and    million  Mike. And it is going to be primarily infill drilling. And it will be more focused on the vertical extent of mineralization versus the horizontal extent  which we focused on in     . That being said  we will certainly drill more holes to the Southwest  where we currently understand the mineralization to be. To the Northeast  probably not so much. We know where the Northeast termination or offset of that mineralization is. And it would  in fact  not reappear until we re into  Hector-Calumet proper. ,-0.042484477162361145,MIXED
So yes. So some extension drilling to the Southwest  lots of vertical -- trying to understand the vertical extent of the mineralization and infilling between those white space holes that we drilled last year.,-0.05033723916858435,NEUTRAL
Mike Niehueser,0.0002472964843036607,NEUTRAL
Well  I m glad you mentioned the vertical because when I look at the cross-section in the most recent release  it seems to -- reading between the lines  you re kind of looking at    -meter block there of this new panel that s being discovered. And then when you look at the other geometry of the veins and how they come together  that it kind of pinches out. But I don t know if -- my mind says that s not necessarily so because you re above the Hector-Calumet  which was historically quite thick. But as the -- get to the bottom of the terminus of the scheduled mine plant at Bermingham  you re getting to that area that really has the best silver grades and the highest lead grades. And I m just wondering if you re going to be targeting under that area because wondering if that s a shoot or a feeder or something like that.,0.03169984742999077,MIXED
Clynton Nauman,0.0001911757281050086,NEUTRAL
Yes. Like I say  I mean  what you re talking about is to the southwest of where we drilled. We feel that there s a certain structural intersection that we have identified -- that the geologists have identified at Bermingham. And we are following that -- the projection of that structural intersection along to the Northeast. And that structure and dissection persists all the way up through the Bellekeno  the Bermingham deposit itself and is the locus for mineralization.,0.019651837181299925,NEUTRAL
Now that does not mean to say that between that structural intersection and where the existing deposit occurs  there is not more mineralization  for sure. It s just that we know that there are targeted mechanisms as such that the meatier parts of the deposit are traditionally around that structural intersection  and that s what we re focused on.,-0.03756908234208822,NEUTRAL
Mike Niehueser,0.0002472964843036607,NEUTRAL
Well  it just seems that you re not near where you can determine that you re closed off at depth and that it s just a matter of drilling and it s getting progressively more expensive. But I just have the sense that you re going to execute a well -- a step-up of operations  but the exploration here this year could be another pivot for you. And that the ending of the year is going to be quite interesting when you look back on the last couple of years. So those are just my questions and comments.,0.00719842710532248,MIXED
Clynton Nauman,0.0001911757281050086,NEUTRAL
Yes. Thanks  Mike. I mean  certainly  it s going to be a very interesting year. And it goes back to Jake s question earlier  which was -- okay  so you re assuming that there s mineralization in this new area. What are you going to do in terms of the mine plan and future development  And those are the things that we at Alexco have to figure out. And I once again go back to the step-by-step progression  which is let s drill it first  figure out what we are looking at and then go the next step.,0.3799501252360642,POSITIVE

Bradley Thrall,0.008154942188411951,NEUTRAL
Yes. Lee  I ll just give you maybe kind of a high level  I mean  summary of all of the protocols and how we currently have to operate. So we are able to bring in employees from outside the Yukon right to the mine site. And they can work  but they must quarantine at the end of their day. So at the end of a typical   -hour day  all employees need to go back to the room. They can t leave their room. Meals are brought to them. They can t use the recreation facilities. We have to keep all of our Yukon employees separated from non-Yukon employees. And that means separate charters to site  separate buses  separate vehicle transportation. We have a full-time nurse on site. So we do daily checks every morning. We have part of our camp that s been isolated off for an isolation unit in case there is -- anybody even gets a sniffle  we pull them out of the main population.,-0.06133805401623249,MIXED
So that s -- it s pretty rigorous  and it s certainly hard on employees to have to kind of live  I guess  if you will  under those types of conditions.

     was a challenging year for the nearly everybody as we face new challenges in public health. Despite the challenges we faced  we are quite hopeful for the future. At Calithera       was a year of execution. We successfully completed and reported results of our global randomized trial in renal cell carcinoma early in       while advancing our pipeline of novel therapeutics. We want to thank all of our employees who have done an extraordinary job of maintaining a high level of professionalism  productivity and dedication at work  particularly towards helping us achieve our goal of reporting top line results of the CANTATA trial in January. We re both appreciative and proud of our entire team for accomplishing a number of challenging goals. And while we are disappointed in the results of the CANTATA trial  we remain enthusiastic for the potential of glutaminase inhibition to be a novel approach to the treatment of cancer. And we remain committed to our mission of being an integrated biotechnology company that develops novel small molecule onco-metabolism drugs  drugs that are targeting tumor and immune cell metabolism pathways for the treatment of cancer and other diseases.,0.41355313382518943,POSITIVE
By building a pipeline of novel therapeutic product candidates  we are creating multiple opportunities to positively impact clinical outcomes for patients and drive development programs towards commercialization. We are continuing to develop telaglenastat  and we are enrolling the randomized KEAPSAKE trial in first line non-small cell lung cancer patients harboring genetic mutations in KEAP or NRF . We also continue to evaluate telaglenastat in multiple indications  including investigator-sponsored trials.,0.009010825742734596,NEUTRAL
Our partnered arginase inhibitor program is ongoing with Incyte where we have a number of clinical trials evaluating CB-     for the treatment of cancer. While we remain committed to and confident in the      development program  we have decided to opt out of our co-development obligations at this time  effective September           as permitted under the terms of the Incyte agreement in order to focus our resources on our own internal development programs. As a result of our decision to opt out  Incyte will pay all costs to develop     .,0.007644031509698834,NEUTRAL
Arginase inhibitors also have potential in the treatment of cystic fibrosis. And accordingly  we selected CB-     a unique oral arginase inhibitor  for the treatment of this patient population.

Thank you  Susan. Let s begin with a more detailed update on telaglenastat  our glutaminase inhibitor in development for the treatment of first-line lung cancer in patients with KEAP  NRF  mutations. Mutations in the KEAP  NRF  pathway  which occur in an estimated     of non-small cell lung cancer patients  are associated with aggressive disease. Numerous recent reports of clinical data have demonstrated that activation of this pathway  either through the loss of KEAP  function or activation of NRF   are associated with poor clinical outcomes among patients with non-small cell lung cancer receiving frontline standard of care therapies  including chemotherapy  immunotherapy and chemoimmunotherapy.,0.12045406550168991,NEUTRAL
Preclinical models have shown that activation of the KEAP  NRF  pathway makes tumors dependent on glutaminase activity for growth and survival  making these tumors exquisitely sensitive to inhibition of glutaminase activity by telaglenastat.,0.00358475063694641,NEUTRAL
The double-blind telaglenastat trial  known as KEAPSAKE  enrolled the first patient in September      and will enroll approximately     patients. Eligible patients are newly diagnosed with Stage IV non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer with tumors that have the KEAP  or NRF  mutation. Patients will be randomized to receive telaglenastat or placebo  in combination with pembrolizumab  carboplatin and pemetrexed. The study will evaluate the safety and investigator-assessed PFS of telaglenastat plus the standard of care chemoimmunotherapy regimen. We plan to share interim data from this trial in the second half of     . We are also conducting an exploratory Phase Ib II trial in collaboration with Pfizer combining telaglenastat with IBRANCE.,0.00847070271265693,NEUTRAL
In       we announced the initiation of the first clinical trial to evaluate our novel arginase inhibitor in cystic fibrosis  and we are pleased with the enrollment to date. The depletion of arginine in cystic fibrosis patients by the enzyme arginase results in reduced production of nitric oxide  a key antimicrobial and bronchodilator. Therefore  arginase inhibitors have potential in the treatment of cystic fibrosis  and we have selected CB-     a unique oral arginase inhibitor solely owned by Calithera  for the treatment of cystic fibrosis.,0.032190187397645786,NEUTRAL
In October       we presented a trial in progress poster describing the trial design at the North American Cystic Fibrosis conference.

Arginase inhibition with CB-    resulted in improved central airway resistance in CFTR knockout mice and decreased lung infection in wild-type and delta F    CFTR-expressing mice infected with pseudomonas aeruginosa. We plan to share data from this trial in the second half of     .,0.07513053540606052,NEUTRAL
We ve also identified CB-     an investigational first-in-class  potent  orally administered IL- I  inhibitor  as a novel immuno-oncology approach to cancer. CB-    is an inhibitor of the enzyme IL- I   an enzyme that is expressed by tumor cells and antigen presenting cells  metabolizes phenylalanine  tyrosine and tryptophan to produce hydrogen peroxide  an inhibitor of T cell function. IL- I  expression has been correlated with poor outcomes in several tumor types  has a potential role in immunization and may decrease the ability of checkpoint therapy to stimulate an antitumor immune response. IL- I  expression is elevated in multiple tumor types with particularly high expression in ovarian and B-cell tumors. New preclinical data for CB-    was presented in November      at the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer Virtual meeting.,0.0015450848295586184,NEUTRAL

And yes  in terms of the data that we would be talking about  it s probably a combination of PFS as well as response rates.

Jonathan  yes  in terms of the -- we re expecting somewhere in the range of    to    patients  worth of data by the end of the year. And I think that s kind of the ballpark. It s -- as we ve talked about before  the analysis is not explicitly defined in the protocol with -- and having a specific sort of statistically driven endpoint or analysis. It s not a futility analysis. It s not an early efficacy analysis. It s an administrative interim that allows us to have an early look at the data and react as appropriate  which could mean any number of things  reaching out to regulators  starting to prepare for a subsequent study. So that s the kind of the spirit of the interim.,-0.08888225257396698,MIXED
And in terms of maturity  I guess  I would say  obviously  patients who were enrolled later as that -- as we get closer to the interim analysis  those patients will be more likely to be censored and have less mature data. The hope is to have hopefully a couple of scans for those patients so that we can get a feel for the median PFS. As we talked about  the median is in the range of   to   months for the control arm  we would expect.

We will read out this year the first data in cystic fibrosis patients. And we have a clear picture of where we might go next  if that data look encouraging and there might be a partnering opportunity somewhere along the cystic fibrosis development time line. And as you know  we do have an earlier stage pipeline assets that are IND ready. We have a CD   small molecule oral inhibitor  and we also have an inhibitor for IL- I . And partnering is a possibility for those as well. And for telaglenastat  we ll wait and see what develops. But we re always open to partnering at the right time for the right reasons.,0.06264358980115503,NEUTRAL

Keith Orford,0.0006914750410942361,NEUTRAL
Yes. Arthur  in terms of enrollment for KEAPSAKE  while we don t usually give sort of specific numbers of patients enrolled  I did mention that there is -- there has been some impact from COVID. I think there s -- it s probably multifactorial  both at the level of the sites who have staff impacted in various ways as well as patients  since this is a front-line study and the patients getting diagnosed in the frontline setting is necessary for patients to be enrolled through the study. So -- and I think there are ways in which COVID is impacting clinical studies  and we re  like everyone else  experiencing that. But as I mentioned  we still remain on track  we think  for data by the end of the year.,0.025722020072862506,NEUTRAL
The -- and then in terms of the IBRANCE study  that study is enrolling  and we re monitoring the data there. I have no real update there from an enrollment perspective. I think we talked about the data probably either this year or next with that study  but hard to be more specific than that at this point.,-0.329110995400697,NEGATIVE

Matt Phipps,0.0006527676014229655,NEUTRAL
Coming back on. Keith  I was wondering if we could talk just -- walk through some  I guess  hypothetical next steps after this interim. So obviously  you ll present the data depending on the level of activity  but is it -- okay  maybe we go take it to the FDA  Or is it  okay  we re just going to continue to let the trial run out  Or is there -- does the trial having some kind of built-in adaptation to expand enrollment to maybe make it pivotal if things are looking good  Just curious what kind of potential next steps are after this interim look in the KEAPSAKE.,-0.012601777911186218,NEUTRAL
Keith Orford,0.0006914750410942361,NEUTRAL
So that s a great question  and those are the kinds of things we re thinking about. For example  we can always reach out to FDA with the data if they re compelling. And for example  talk about breakthrough designation  talk about either amending the current study or starting the planning for a subsequent pivotal Phase III. So those are the kinds of things that  by looking early  we can kind of get a start on what we think the best path is. And again  all of those are really options. And probably an interaction with FDA would be part of that if we were looking to move forward with an accelerated sort of path to approval in some way.,0.22449092473834753,NEUTRAL

Keith Orford,0.0006914750410942361,NEUTRAL
So I would say FDA -- interacting with the FDA is independent of any kind of presentation at a meeting. So I wouldn t link those to each other. And frankly  what we re talking about isn t necessarily even a -- I think what we ve talked about in the past is that this may or may not be an actual conference presentation  so -- or may be a prelude to a conference presentation. So that the discussion this year wouldn t necessarily be in the context of a conference.,-0.065508839674294,NEUTRAL

Nick Abbott,0.00022634107153862715,NEUTRAL
And I apologize I missed nearly all of the prepared remarks. So I want to ask a question on the NCI study of telaglenastat and I know you may not have a lot of insight into that trial  but was updated at the end of January  they re still talking about having data in June. So do you have any insight into that trial  And is this a way also to help derisk KEAPSAKE in some of these patients who may also have a KEAP  mutation ,-0.14763977378606796,NEGATIVE
Keith Orford,0.0006914750410942361,NEUTRAL
Yes. So actually  we -- as we talk about of -- hi  Nick  by the way  we don t have any real insight at this point that we can share on the study. So I think it s an interesting question  whether it s about KEAP mutant patients or just looking at the combination with TKIs targeting driver mutations  I think it s an interesting study and we look forward to learning more about it. But at this point  it s not something that we re able to speak to.,-0.022614646703004837,MIXED
Nick Abbott,0.00022634107153862715,NEUTRAL

Can you remind us when the colorectal and non-small cell lung cohorts were open for the KRAS mutations  And is that the data you re referring to is possibly being available by the end of this year or beginning of next ,-0.027569349855184555,NEUTRAL
Keith Orford,0.0006914750410942361,NEUTRAL
So that s a good question. You re testing my memory of when the study opened  and I m not sure I m going to be able to answer that accurately without looking it up. So I apologize. I can say the pancreatic -- the pancreatic cohort opened more recently. So that was one that we added to the study by amendment. And so that was  I think  opened late last year. But the timing of the colorectal data -- or the colorectal and lung cohorts opening  I don t know if I can answer that for you as we sit here. I will say  though  that the data that we could present  could be those data and the pancreatic  I think  data from any or all of those cohorts is possible. But we ll get back to you on the timing of that  the start of the study. I m sure I should have that ingrained in my head somewhere.,-0.057496845722198486,NEGATIVE

Okay. Good afternoon  and let s turn to Page   of our presentation. So that this gives you a summary of our      results. Revenue -- now       is a year plagued by COVID-   and also the more significant is oil price drop that affects Husky Oil in a material way. And so this -- all these result has been taken into account of all this problem  and you will see that revenue  the total group dropped    and EBITDA dropped     and EBIT should drop    .,-0.19225388765335083,NEUTRAL
And our earnings  minus    . And net earning per share at   .    minus     and correspondingly   EPS  is minus    .,-0.45272939559072256,NEGATIVE
But however  because of -- we have -- the operation has been operated very tight and then we have some mega transaction come through  and then the debt ratio has dropped from     last year to    . So that we can see that this is a very excellent result because what happened at the oil front is so difficult  and the figure come through negative against us. It is so bad  but thanks to the VHA deal that we merged with TPG and thanks for the tower deal. And then we actually generate enough profit to overcome the mega losses incurred by Husky Oil.,0.08222592808306217,MIXED
And also during this year  we also fixed Husky which we will go into more detail by merging with Cenovus as the end result is a much better animal. And if you look at the -- today  when we merged with -- we were about     and then now Cenovus is over    . And then if you go back to what we own in Husky  the  equipment  is about   .  . So the result of the merger gives us a lot of hope and then we are  Indiscernible ,0.18546804413199425,POSITIVE
If you go to Page    okay  give you the EBITDA because Husky Oil order country and percentage changes. If you see that instead of   circle  we now have   circles. One is the outer one is the actual  auditors  because Husky suddenly become negative. So that every other thing become bigger. And then the inner one -- the outer one is the actual one then the inner one is the were set right count and if you look at the graph  the chart on the right-hand side you saw that -- you saw the waterfall of how the EBITDA dropped.,-0.2968960851430893,NEGATIVE
So we go from      underlying EBITDA and then the part basically dropped   .  billion.,-0.21526798512786627,NEUTRAL
Actually  it s mostly came from last year as first half and the second half is structured much less  and it went to the fourth quarter. Actually  it is quite a good performance. And the same thing is on the retail and then the retail is also suffered by the first half when the whole business dropped    . But then the second half was doing quite good. Actually  second half was better than last year.,0.03805861854925752,MIXED
This is why. So the retail -- so as a whole year  it only dropped   .  billion. It s mostly come from first half.,-0.13989583030343056,NEUTRAL
And then the interest structure doesn t really affect the -- by the COVID-   so it s doing -- it shows a green color. And Husky is the big casualty and which we will describe to you later.,-0.0761878602206707,NEUTRAL
And then the telephone group is basically -- although it showed the HKD  .  billion negative is actually is doing quite good. Actually  if you look at the underlying performance  it s similar to last year. So what happened is that this -- there was a nonrecurring item or onetime item happened last year  which is a    billion happen in Italy when we shift some compensation from some vendor and then about   .  billion in -- from the   U.K.  where we got some compensation -- some benefit from the VAT. And then there was    billion from the corporate side  where there some adjustment came through. Actually from the operations  Indiscernible  you will see later is quite stable.,-0.1736583886668086,MIXED
And the same thing happened to Asia  and then it is quite a stable operation and now. So on the head office front  I would -- basically the interest  I will let Frank talk more to it  okay  So this year  you will see that most of the -- majority of the income come from Europe and Hong Kong become more enough because of the Husky Oil doesn t contribute anything.,-0.19500372000038624,NEUTRAL
So the next page  Page  . Frank  on the cash flow side. Can you take over ,-0.17759783286601305,NEUTRAL
Frank Sixt,0.0006995918847678695,NEUTRAL
The first sort of easy snapshot of what the cash flow profile of the group was like. So operating cash flow is just a very quick proxy. It s EBITDA from our subsidiaries plus distributions from our associates less CapEx and investments. And so obviously  on that measure  we had a meaningful decline from       right  And you see that in the bars  basically  the result for this year at    .  billion is the -- what you get by subtracting    .  billion -- sorry     .  billion from    .  billion on the columns on the right. And the distribution of that obviously speaks pretty well for itself.,-0.28129131719470024,NEGATIVE
Interestingly  though  this rough measure tells a lot less of the story this year. So if we go very quickly to the next slide  the -- there s really no important number on Slide  . There s really no important message just to convey here  except that  essentially  everybody is living within their means. And in fact  everybody is living within CapEx and investment envelopes that are less than depreciation except  right  in the telecoms group and in HAT  where we are still in a meaningful investment phase. But obviously  the message is even on the operating free cash flow measure  right  we re very well covered in terms of our spending profile.,0.02155075967311859,MIXED
The next page  Page    is actually quite a little bit more interesting this year because it looks at the whole free cash flow picture. And when you do that  you obviously have to take into account of what s happening to interest expenses and financing costs. You have to take account of what s happening in taxes. And you have to take account of what s happening in working capital. So it s a slightly complex chart.,-0.03835732117295265,MIXED
But to simplify it  if you go to the right-hand side  right  last year s free cash flow  underlying free cash flow after tax  after working capital movements  after financing cost  et cetera was    .  billion.,0.02780912257730961,NEUTRAL
Now we ve just gone through the reduction in EBITDA that we suffered  right  during the year of    .  billion  but we recovered significantly more than that  right  in terms of the  believe it or not  overall level of dividends that we received from our associates excluding Husky Energy  of course. But interest and financing costs and taxes paid were down very significantly. So in the aggregate  by HKD  .  billion.,-0.2511473139747977,NEGATIVE
And working capital was managed very  very tightly all around from the group. I have to  in particular  single out the retail division  right  for their excellent job in managing working capital over the course of the year. So the swing from year-to-year is    billion. So the free cash flow underlying profile for      is    .  billion  right  which is fully    billion-plus better.,0.03007611632347107,POSITIVE
And obviously  I think a very encouraging picture in terms of the group s financial profile.,0.40908957179635763,POSITIVE
If we go to the next page  right  This is this is Page  . The group s financial profile  not surprisingly  after everything that I ve just said  right  is still very strong. Net debt  as we said  has reduced  has reduced substantially in absolute dollars and has continued actually to -- we ve been continuing to reduce gross debt right in the first   months of this year.,0.006843358278274536,POSITIVE
Our net debt ratio is at   .  . One of the things that works against us there is the movement in sterling and euros  right  over year-on-year  which increases net debt. And as a result  negatively affects the ratio. So you could argue that on a like-for-like basis that the ratio is a little bit better than that.,-0.13873717095702887,NEUTRAL
Our ratings stayed stable. Our weighted average maturity at  .  years is very manageable. We are still further down in terms of the average cost of debt capital at  .  .,0.25038699619472027,POSITIVE
We re now  after swaps      in floating rates and     in fixed rates. That s again less floating than last year. We were     last year and     fixed. So we ve been taking some advantage of moving out along the curve a bit  right  as we medium- longer-term rates  obviously  have been at historic lows.,0.015907004475593567,NEUTRAL
I don t really have anything to say in terms of our debt maturity profile  except  as I mentioned  we reduced gross debt already in Q  led by EUR  .  billion  roughly USD   billion. And CKI  of course  will report that they redeemed the perpetual of   .  billion right  in full  right  in February  I believe so.,-0.23308693058788776,NEGATIVE
I think that s all I have to say about the overall financial profile. And the next section is ports. So Canning ,-0.19275396317243576,NEGATIVE
Canning Fok,-0.39730931958183646,NEGATIVE
Okay. Yes. The ports this year is a difficult year in the first half because of the China shutdown and then towards the middle of the year is the European shutdown. But then it really recovered well towards the end of the year. So that is the whole story.,-0.003160032443702221,MIXED
So that we still -- our asset is USD    billion and then     berths and    ports in    countries. And last year  we handled   .  million TEU  which is    below     .,-0.02650393731892109,NEUTRAL
And then the EBITDA is     billion -- almost     billion and     of     . And if you look at  basically  if you will look at the waterfall chart from      to       you will see that actually  if you look at the first red is the main line and so basically it s all come from because in the first half we reduced Shanghai by      so that the reduction mainly comes from the reductions of interest. It s not really from the operation.,-0.20718600694090128,NEUTRAL
And then if you saw a bigger figure    .  billion from Asia  Australia and all those. One of the major big is about      million and then come from the close of the  Dan  mine and then we provide  if you take the opportunity to provide some of the middle -- small Middle East port. And so that there is about      million. And then another      million from -- if you compare to last year  demand because we finished the concession in September.,-0.016412675380706787,NEUTRAL
So that if you take that away  the other is a small drop. So that actually it was better in the second half already. And then the corporate is at     -- almost      million  it s basically the dividend from OOCL  which we had last year  we don t have this year. So the ports this year have a difficult time  but they hold  they fought pretty well. And then about the September -- August  September onwards  actually  the throughput start coming back.,-0.01407061517238617,MIXED
And then we still see a strong throughput growth until now this year.,0.16514605656266212,NEUTRAL
If you go to Page    somebody move the page in the screen. And so that shows you the monthly throughput. And if you look at that  the trust is all -- the green is about     . And you can see that all for the main trust Mainland  Europe and Asia  Australia  if you show -- it shows that in Asia and then after June  they are all doing quite well. And then in Mainland  it is the same thing.,0.0866737887263298,NEUTRAL
In Europe  actually  it is getting better and better in the summer. And then it s getting better in the last   months and the same as in the other Asian and Australian ports. So that the story is that -- is coming back  the stories. And then we see strong performance in January and February and also March up to today  right ,0.4251577197574079,POSITIVE
Page     let s go to the famous retail. I think we got Dominic here. He is not only a head office  Director   but he also is the CEO of Watson. So I will invite him to talk Page   .,0.1534227328374982,NEUTRAL

Okay. Well  thank you  Canning. And I m sure all of you will be interested and anxious to know what the retail division have -- was doing last year and also into the first   months of this year.,0.44329388975165784,POSITIVE
But before commenting on the slides that follow  I would like to pass on the following messages so that to put things into the right perspective.      was a testing year for all retailers in the world and A.S. Watson has proven to be resilient versus competition  with total sales dropping only  .   versus     .,0.03898927941918373,NEUTRAL
The first half of the year was very challenging with massive store closures  especially in China. But then we have a very robust recovery in the second half  both in terms of sales and profit.,0.012577216140925884,MIXED
To illustrate  EBITDA in the second half increased significantly by      when compared to the first half. And like what Canning said      increase over the same period second half of     . This was helped by large -- by the large loyalty member base and an acceleration in our digital transformation. At the same time  the O O strategy  i.e.  offline plus online  has enabled us to significantly increase our digital sales by leveraging our physical store network. So the physical stores actually helped the e-commerce side. So as a result  the e-commerce sales increased over     in     . And to update you on the last -- in the first   months of this year  EBITDA and EBIT has already returned to the      level.,0.16584469671943225,NEUTRAL
So now let s go to the slide. So this gives you an overall perspective of how the retail division was doing last year. Some corporate information on the left. The retail division is the world s largest international health and beauty retailer  operating in    markets with     loyalty members worldwide. One of the largest loyalty programs in the world.,0.11667896714061499,NEUTRAL
And more importantly      of our total sales actually came from this member base.,-0.018828220665454865,NEUTRAL
Our exclusive sales participation reached     of total sales creating a lot of uniqueness and differentiation. The business strategy for the past few years has been focusing on O O  off-line plus online. It s a new terminology that I want to elaborate. In fact  it leverages on our extensive network and also our CRM member base. The reason for this O O strategy is quite obvious.,0.11250102228950709,NEUTRAL
Because our data analysis shows that an average O O customer  i.e.  a customer who buys both off-line and online  spend  x as much as they spend by customers who only shop in physical stores. So there s huge sales upside potential for us going forward.,-0.18815828766673803,NEUTRAL
And if you want to understand more under this very important O O strategy  Malina Ngai  the Chief Operating Officer of Retail  would be very happy to elaborate for you in the Q A session.,0.20006873505190015,NEUTRAL
On store numbers  the division has        stores at year-end  an increase of   .     of the stores are in Asia and     in Europe. In terms of EBITDA  despite the tough trading environment marked by store closures and reduced footfall  EBITDA only dropped     or     in local currency to    .  billion. Moreover  if you exclude a onetime dilution gain of      million recognized in      as a result of a merger between the partnership of China and Yonghui of China  the EBITDA decrease is even lower at    .,-0.0065269675105810165,NEUTRAL
So the underlying EBITDA decrease is only    . But reportedly      in local currency.,-0.09261472057551146,NEUTRAL
In terms of the split      of the EBITDA is in Asia and     in Europe. On EBITDA growth  the waterfall chart on the right shows decreases in all divisions  except other retail  the green block  which shows a   .  billion increase. This represents a strong performance of PARKnSHOP  the supermarket chain  as well as Fortress  the electrical retail chain in Hong Kong and strong performance in the Watsons water and beverage division.,0.10368939547333866,NEUTRAL
On the other hand  the health and beauty business had a total EBITDA decrease of      around   .  billion  attributed by a decrease of   .   billion in health and beauty China  followed by      million decrease in health and beauty Asia       million in Western Europe and      million in Eastern Europe.,-0.030142230913043022,NEUTRAL
Noteworthy is that the EBITDA decreases in health and beauty mainly took place in the first half of the year  as Canning mentioned  as also the Chairman mentioned when it dropped    . But since then  we saw a very strong recovery in the second half when we witnessed even a small positive growth of  .  . So net-net  the total EBITDA for the year is    .  billion  which includes an FX translation gain of      million.,0.13547391071915627,NEUTRAL
For EBITDA margin percentage  it s worth mentioning in the lower right-hand table as a result of decreases in EBITDA dollar  the EBITDA margin percentage of the various health and beauty divisions were also adversely affected. Health and beauty China saw a   percentage points drop from     to     whereas the other divisions dropped   percentage point. The wider margin percentage decrease in China is due to the significant drop in EBITDA  as aforementioned  as well as a shift in category mix.,-0.15108005446381867,NEUTRAL
What I mean by category mix is that under the epidemic  we saw less consumption of the higher-margin skin care and cosmetic products  while consumption of the lower margin personal and body care products were still in demand. So we believe this is reversible post COVID  and we are seeing it happening in recent months.,-0.10582497715950012,NEUTRAL
Next slide  Slide   . And in fact  the next   slides shows the quarterly sales changes and their respective health and beauty divisions during the year. The blocks in the middle illustrate the quarterly EBITDA change year-on-year  and the charts underneath simply illustrated temporary store closure profile.,0.004750477150082588,NEUTRAL
First  for the health and beauty China chart on the left  we can see the biggest sales decrease was in Q  when the sales dropped     in February with over       temporary store closures. With the closed stores gradually be opened in subsequent months  we can see from the graph that the negative sales growth improved. Also worth mentioning is that the sales reduction is smaller than the stores traffic reduction  which is illustrated by the red dotted line underneath the sales change graph. This was the result of increases in customer conversion rates and higher average transaction -- transaction value so that the sales decrease is lower than the traffic decrease. Overall  the total sales decrease for the year is      with first half decrease of      improving to     in the second half. So we have a tough first half but recovered nicely in the second half.,-0.08534115180373192,NEUTRAL
Correspondingly  as shown in the red box in the middle  the EBITDA dropped     in the first half and narrowed to only     in the second half with total EBITDA decrease of     for the year. Nonetheless  the silver lining is that there s a rapid proliferation of online sales  which increased      year-on-year. The increase in online sales was held by the milestone initiative  which I mentioned last year during the internal results  whereby our        plus store staff remained connected with our loyalty members through the WeChat enterprise app to retain sales. So even during the close downs  during the pandemic  our customers are still engaged with our       -odd store staff or sales agents and beauty advisers. So O O participation has reached at      China got the highest O O sales participation within the retail group.,-0.12787091359496117,NEUTRAL
Now next for health and beauty Asia. We see a sharp decrease of around     in Q  as a result of store closures in a number of countries in April. Overall  the sales decrease for the year is      with first half decrease of      improving to     in the second half. So on EBITDA  I must point out that Hong Kong had a major adverse impact on the division s EBITDA  with a sharp decrease of  indiscernible  tourist arrivals due to the border closures  our Hong Kong Watson stores located in tourist areas were severely impacted. But on a more positive note  excluding these tourist stores  the rest of the portfolio is healthy and profitable.,-0.11184359434992075,NEUTRAL
And the tourist stores are being turning around with encouraging initial results that we see recently. Overall  the Asia division managed to narrow its year-on-year EBITDA decline from     in the first half to only    in the second half. So on a country basis  Malaysia  Thailand were doing better and leading the recovery with      full year sales  matching that of     . So Malaysia  Thailand  these contributed to maintain the sales versus     . Philippines still suffer from a prolonged period of quarantine in key cities. And lastly  for the health and beauty Asia division  the online sales growth is     .,-0.09729152731597424,MIXED
So next slide  Slide   . Similar chart for Western Europe and Eastern Europe  okay  Now first  on Western Europe. Well  Western Europe is like a tale of   cities. In the Netherlands and Germany  all of our health and beauty stores remain open during the lock down because they are deemed essential retail. Both countries  Netherlands and Germany saw positive sales and positive EBITDA growth during the year because the stores are located in suburban areas and close to supermarkets where the footfalls were not much affected by COVID.,0.030480504035949707,NEUTRAL
Whereas in U.K.  although our health and beauty stores also remain open  but they are more located in the high suites and shopping malls where footfall drops was both apparent. So as a result  both sales and EBITDA in U.K. declined significantly versus     . However  we are confident that when the lockdown measures start to ease  which is now with the vaccination program  the U.K. business are poised for a robust recovery this year  and we are very confident of that.,0.021013271063566208,MIXED
So on the luxury business  while the health and beauty stores were being open  the perfumery  the luxury business  although located in the same countries  for example  the Netherlands  the product is open but the  Indiscernible  luxury business has to be closed because they are deemed nonessential. So net-net  with all these counterbalancing factors  the total sales for the year in Western Europe only dropped    overall     in the first half and recovered strongly to only    in the second half.,-0.2741736085154116,NEGATIVE
So likewise  for EBITDA  we see a very strong recovery in the second half by turning around a year-on-year reduction of     in the first half to a growth of     in the second half. So as a result  total EBITDA decrease for the year is only   . And online sales for this division has recorded a healthy     growth year-on-year.,0.3227815739810467,POSITIVE
So last  we turn to the Eastern Europe chart. So overall  the total sales of Eastern Europe remained flat at the same level as     . With    drop in the first half and compensated by    growth in the second half. So    drop first half     increase in second half. And the sales and EBITDA profile of Eastern Europe actually is dominated by Poland  where they had a     EBITDA drop in the first half  but a robust recovery to positive EBITDA growth of    in the second half.,0.013560911640524864,NEUTRAL
So total EBITDA decrease for this division is limited to only   . So online sales growth for the division is also very good at     .,0.1650962084531784,POSITIVE
So in summary  we have looked at various divisions  Asia  China  Western Europe  Eastern Europe. But overall  the retail division has shown a high degree of resilience  attributed to its well balanced and well-diversified portfolio and the online capability actually have benefited and quickly improved during the pandemic year in support of our successful O O strategy. So this is a very quick summary of retail happening last year. And I now pass back to Canning on the infrastructure.,0.23647704534232616,NEUTRAL
Frank Sixt,0.0006995918847678695,NEUTRAL
Yes. I don t think we need to dwell on it. I m sure CKI will have reported in detail what the drivers were  right  of its earnings reduction in     . A couple of anomalies. One is some meaningful COVID events effects  somewhere in the area of HKD     million from assets like PARKnFLY in Canada  where obviously nobody was flying and therefore  nobody was parking.,-0.2472661251667887,NEGATIVE
In addition  there was a very major accounting volatility relating to deferred taxes  right  which resulted in a charge of HKD  .  billion because of a    increase in the tax rate in the U.K. that was announced during the course of     . That s quite problematic  right  because it s not a real cash volatility or even a real cash flow risk.,-0.37451760028488934,NEGATIVE
Most of the regulated assets have  in effect  a pass-through of the actual cash tax burden that is paid out in any given year by the regulated utilities. So this anomaly  of course  grows larger with the increase in      with the proposed increase in tax rates that we re expecting somewhere in the U.K.  which would go up by     and it s something that we ll be looking very closely at because it s becoming a very distorting earnings volatility with no real meaning in cash terms.,-0.20594060025177896,NEGATIVE
Other than that  there are some headwinds in the business in terms of regulatory resets. We all know that. Regulatory resets are tending in one direction  which is not that surprising  given how far long-term interest rates have dropped all around the world. The timetable on the lower right sort of sets out what is to be reset during which periods  and it will be what it will be. Needless to say  in value terms  at the same low interest rate environment that s driving the regulatory reset environment is probably also supportive of the valuation environment for infrastructure assets.,-0.08520606672391295,MIXED
So we ll have to see where all those puts and takes take you.,0.12823031656444073,NEUTRAL

Why don t you do it ,-0.2422250248491764,NEGATIVE
Frank Sixt,0.0006995918847678695,NEUTRAL
Thank you. Okay. So Slide     I m not going to dwell on the Husky debacle. I mean what happens when all of the commodity price supporting your production goes through the floor and goes way below your cash breakeven level  let alone your earnings breakeven level and you combine that with effectively a collapse in the markets for refined products largely due to the collapse in demand for jet fuel. And you have an unprecedented Armageddon  and you get the kind of net loss profile  which is shown on this slide  which wax CKHH  whichever line you choose to look at  was an unprecedented loss.,0.11091634631156921,POSITIVE
Now interestingly  it is a noncash loss in the sense that Husky only paid us a relatively small dividend. So in terms of this impact on our cash and our financial profile relatively low  but it is indicative of a pretty significant value loss in Husky  and you can t ignore that.,-0.17141138203442097,NEUTRAL
Of course  we were fortunate and that we were able to agree and then in early January  complete a merger with Cenovus Energy. That merger  we ve already talked about a little bit  but it creates not only one of the largest number   producer in Canada  but also one of the lowest-cost producers and one of the most integrated producers in North America  which is a superb place to be. What that translates into is a WTI breakeven  which is very significantly below where Husky is WTI breakeven might ever have been considered to be.,0.18805707152932882,MIXED
And as a result of that  in the current commodity price environment  which let us hope that it persists during the course of the year  we are probably experiencing netbacks that are more than double than what they would otherwise have been so in last year s price environment. So the good news there is that in terms of value creation  Cenovus is a company that does not need to incur exploration expenses in order to support its production profile and its reserve profile and a reasonable level of growth in its production. That being the case  most of the kind of cash flow that s being generated in this environment can go to debt reduction as can the realization of synergies  which have been targeted at a run rate in cash terms of CAD  .  billion a year as an exit rate coming out of this year. So you can see that  that potentially adds to the value of the equity position that we have very materially.,0.01325998455286026,MIXED
Just to go over that very quickly. We actually hold a number of warrants in addition to our shares. So on a fully diluted basis  our interest is   .   . The warrants are at   .   strike price  they have a  -year term. So they are very valuable little pieces of paper right now. Canning mentioned that we ve experienced a terrific recovery in value already. So for our   .     that s a CAD  .  billion gain from the Husky low point  which was at around    a share. So it is -- as mergers go  so far  we re very happy because it s almost a  x here.,0.3622839953750372,POSITIVE
So I think I ll stop there and hand back to Canning for telecoms.,-0.30700563034042716,NEGATIVE
Canning Fok,-0.39730931958183646,NEGATIVE
Okay. So much for Husky. And I think the combined animal is a much better animal than Husky standalone. Similar production of oil quantities but at a much higher quality and much lower cost. So that I think we should be able to take advantage of this situation.,0.35269081965088844,POSITIVE
Now let s go to Page    on telecommunications. So that the way -- so that this company had total revenue of     billion revenue  but then it dropped about    in local currency. And of course  during the COVID period  which is couple most of the time  a lot of the time in Europe in various times. And the gross add is -- has dropped. But however  the trend is also doing good.,-0.028194946702569723,MIXED
And then of course  the one thing that we miss out is a reduction in the roaming income  okay  So that our customer base is   .  million  so down    and our -- but then our ARPU is getting better because people stay home and I suppose they have nothing to do  and then they spend more time on the phone. And of course  you can see the usage is     more.,-0.1355510614812374,MIXED
And then during last year  we actually do a lot of things on  G. And you just be  indiscernible  of the  G capability  we start rolling out everywhere. And then as the Chairman pointed out in the press conference  actually  we just got hold of      megahertz of -- of     at a price which is almost     of what we paid for the last time around  which is very good. And in fact  I just want to say that it s the first time in our career  our U.K. spectrum position is more than competitive than the others. Our  G   .     is much more than our competitor. And then the first time that we have    megahertz of lower spectrum at      which is very  very good to us.,0.2059093862771988,POSITIVE
So if you look at the right-hand side  the middle of the slide  and then you see the waterfall chart. And I think  basically  it s just summarize what I said  take away the one-off or nonrecurring one  actually the business is similar to last year. So this group holding very well. And then actually  the slight red in U.K.  you can just say that is because of the cost in holding the  G spectrum. And we have to pay a spectrum fee  and this amount was more than what we did last year.,0.054607734084129333,MIXED
And if you -- so EBITDA margin is more -- U.K. is always still in a work in progress but has improving. And then the margin other than U.K. is more almost dropped. It s quite good Italy       Sweden       Austria       even Ireland    . So the   need to improve Denmark and U.K. On Page     you saw the details.,0.3610608782619238,POSITIVE
And I just want to draw you the line is EBITDA less CapEx      billion for the   U.K. group  which is quite good. And then CapEx is a little bit higher at     billion. The depreciation just for equipment alone  you saw the     billion which is used in both CAC and spectrum.,-0.2308642789721489,NEGATIVE
But if you just take those   out  it s about     billion  so that our CapEx is still higher at     billion and higher than the     billion were right in the spend. And this is a continuous work that we need to improve. But however  because this is to build out  G and actually  we do have business trend so that when we do build  they should be able to sell it. So to generate income. Hopefully  that will be a key component for the business for the next   years.,0.030549325048923492,NEUTRAL

Yes. And I think the story on our tower sales is well known. So I just want to make clear that -- so that everybody understands what we received in      and booked was proceeds of HKD   .  billion. And what we recorded is a gain of HKD   .  billion in the year. The remainder of the aggregate     billion of consideration comes in this year in     . That s already started with the completion of the sale in Sweden in January. But of course  the   biggest sales remain to be completed. That s the towers in Italy and the tower assets in the U.K.  including the lion s share of the build-to-suit program  which falls in the U.K. That we anticipate will bring in additional proceeds of    .  billion and an additional gain in      of    .  billion.,0.06342152506113052,NEUTRAL

What do we do with the cash flow  Obviously  what we did with the cash was what you do in relatively dark and uncertain times. We first reduced gross debt. We -- I said in the original announcement last November that we would be considering market share buyback programs  and that remains the case when these proceeds come in  I think it s quite possible that we will be in execution mode. But again  as we said in the announcement  always subject to a full evaluation of the company s position and the market s position and the world as we see it at the time.,-0.05311046354472637,NEUTRAL

Okay. And then I just want to -- just to emphasize on this transaction is very convenient for us  both the VHA and this one because of the big loss we ve incurred in Husky and this  one  actually help us to overcome the losses that we did suffer from the  indiscernible  loss that we suffered from Husky. And go to Page   . HAT is nothing much to talk about. The Indonesian business  I think that the exciting thing is not the result.,0.14935040660202503,MIXED
The exciting thing is that we are able to come to a preliminary agreement with Indosat so that we merge the   companies  and everything is in progress and then the   parties are working up nicely. Hopefully  we can have something to sign  and then there s a goodwill on   parties.,0.27866715122945607,POSITIVE
And then if you look at the red color in Indonesia  it s basically  it s not from the operation. There was an exchange gain that they booked last year. And which is not occurring this year. Other than that  they have increased margin by     but also because of they have a bigger network. So we also increased cost by   . So the operation is similar to the year before.,-0.19789637811481953,NEGATIVE
And Vietnam  I think I want to mention a special mention because we are a small player in a difficult market. We have a small team  and I just want to mention that the new CEO  the female CEO that we have founded has been doing extremely well.

I use one example  one subsidiary of Hutch  CKI. This year  the cash flow is stronger than the previous year. But because of the impairment of deferred tax charges  earnings is down. But if you look closely at the regulated business  the rules of the regulation allow the operator to collect the increase -- the difference in the increase in tax in future years. So actually  there s no destruction of value when the tax rate goes up  but because we abide by accounting rule  we will have to take a hit now  but we have a higher reported profit in later years which is confusing to some people  but the accounting rule is that way.,-0.033781553618609905,MIXED

So we actually  in       we managed to recruit millions more customers who shop with us online. And secondly      million loyalty members because of the digital transformation  so we can digitally connect to them. So in       we actually doubled the development of our digital assets  meaning content  to continue to engage them and get them to continue to shop with us.,0.034963206853717566,NEUTRAL
And in fact  actually  in several markets  we become top brands in our Instagram and Facebook as well.,0.058405213290825486,NEUTRAL
Our O O strategy has helped us to also transform the way we sell  okay  this is important because traditionally  any retailers say they would be doing their business offline and then online separately. So for us  actually  in       our store team in the store they are able to use WhatsApp  WeChat  telephone to help us to engage the customers and they convert sales also on the digital platform. So this is how the O O strategy help us to drive more growth.,0.11103032181563322,NEUTRAL
And finally  because of our physical store penetration  so our O O strategy help us to have that fulfillment flexibility. So even during COVID  when our online sales growth  just now already mentioned is      so it s doubled  we re still able to deliver within   hour  within   hours or within the day doing COVID because we will to turn some of the physical store and to support the fulfillment.,0.21998934808652848,NEUTRAL
So in summary  the O O strategy has accelerated a lot in     . And the physical store will continue to be a core touch point in this strategy. And in terms of store opening plan  we will continue to have store opening in Asia Europe  residentials  locations and shopping malls  provide the financial and modern expansion.

Okay. Thank you. Thank you  everyone. The next question is about infrastructure. What is the outlook of CKI in      ,0.3817889792844653,POSITIVE
Dominic Lai,0.00027395604411140084,NEUTRAL
Now there are things that I think the market knows already  and maybe I can add a few new things. What the market already knows is that there will be resets. And for the regulated business  the resets happen every   to   years. So it s always go  go  go until we have the year reset. And then goes down a bit  and then it goes up again.,-0.27652766089886427,NEGATIVE
So this is normal for the business.,0.04189143888652325,NEUTRAL
So in       there will be a couple of resets  which is part of the anticipated made plan for CKI. So that the market knows already. And the -- not already also know that we are always looking for new opportunities. The new one is a new farm in Canada and providing pretty good stable return. So those are the basic things.,0.057793028652668,NEUTRAL
Now going forward  there are   things that maybe I can share. One is last -- night before last  the CMA has confirmed that the position on our appeal against the regulator.,0.019754931330680847,NEUTRAL
Now in U.K.  the regulator is usually the person setting the rate. If you are unhappy with the initial judgment  you can appeal to the CMA. In that scenario  most of the water operators accepted the regulator s portfolio.,-0.0914474492892623,NEUTRAL
We don t think it s there  and we appeal to the CMA. And all I can say is that the result of the CMA is a big improvement from the regulators  original reset. We don t think it is      what we want  but it s just acceptable. And it is an improvement from the regulator.,0.4349505486898124,POSITIVE
Now the importance of that judgment is that not only does it set a rate for the water business  but it is a cornerstone for all other infrastructure resets in the U.K. in the coming months and years. So it will affect the rates for gas as well as electricity. So   days ago  the decision was as a time change.,-0.04664178006350994,NEUTRAL
I don t know whether it s  .  days or   days. But the recent judgment is quite important news for CKI and for the U.K. utility business.,-0.01406879723072052,NEUTRAL
The second one  second news  maybe I can share is a breaking news. Literally about an hour ago    utility asset was sold in the U.K. at     premium to RAP  that s what we infer from the announcement. Now if you use that ratio  then the assets in CKI are worth a lot more than the share price would indicate.,-0.23759428225457668,NEGATIVE
The -- most of the assets are acquired by CKI in much lower premium to RAP. And so this confirms that in this market  there s still a lot of -- I use the word  Indiscernible  treasures. That is within the Hutch Group IPO and some of the CKI assets. So some of the valuations are yet to be fully appreciated.,0.19539389573037624,NEUTRAL

Okay. I think that in the budget  they show that they will be much improved. And actually what we would like to do is to get the company back to where we were before when we talk about the merger with go to which is we made EBITDA of      million. After the merger fell through  I think my team somehow cut this and changed and then get into trouble with IT and all those still keep on having one concern after the other so that as a result  we have a brand-new management team since beginning of last year  and that has been very effective and a nice change. I m not saying that the last team is no good.,-0.04965556412935257,MIXED

Great. Thank you  Carolina. Good morning or good afternoon and welcome to Canacol s fourth quarter      conference call.      the corporation achieved several important goals with respect to growing its gas base in Colombia  including a     increase in realized natural gas sales year-over-year  a     return on capital employed  strong and stable operating margins at an average of      a    increase in  P reserves year-over-year related to continued exploration and development success  representing a       P reserve replacement ratio.,0.48609682073583826,POSITIVE
We were also awarded two new conventional gas exploration blocks in the      exploration bid round. All of this was achieved despite the global COVID-   pandemic impacting demand for gas in Colombia  and our ability to operate in the field when country-wide or local pandemic related restrictions were in place.,0.036256379913538694,NEUTRAL
Our success was possible  thanks to the hard work of our teams that have strong processes in place to deal with the pandemic and the strong long-term fundamentals of the Colombian gas market  which had allowed us to contract the majority of our production capacity under fixed price take-or-pay gas sales contracts.,0.3450930941326078,POSITIVE
Realized natural gas sales during Q  were     million standard cubic feet per day  a    decrease from the same period in       but a    increase from the third quarter of     .

Drilling operations were halted in late March by COVID  which was the main reason why despite restarting drilling operations with   weeks in July  only six wells were drilled and completed compared to the    we had originally planned. All six wells drilled in       of which two were exploration wells and one was an appraisal well successfully encountered gas contributing to the continued growth in these areas we re able to report at year-end.,0.03785095363855362,NEUTRAL
We achieved       P reserve replacement ratio and a    increase in our  P gas reserve base to     billion cubic feet  approximately   -year reserve life index under current production. Our gas exploration drilling results over the past   years have yielded an industry leading     hit rate for commercial discoveries.,0.10297815140802413,NEUTRAL
The net present value of future net revenue from reserve  discounted at     is now estimated at  .  billion on an after tax basis  and  .  billion on a pre-tax basis  respectively  which equates to a CAD   .   per share of reserve value and a CAD  .   per share of  P net asset value as of the end of December       respectively.,0.00038926534762140363,NEUTRAL

Thanks  Charle. Although the global pandemic made it a uniquely challenging year       was nonetheless a great year financially for Canacol and its stakeholders as we continue to execute our plan to develop our growing natural gas business. Largely driven by having a full year with higher gas transportation capacity  following the completion of the pipeline expansion in August of       we reported approximately      million in funds from operations for the full year of       a     increase from      despite sales volumes being negatively impacted by temporary COVID related reduction in demand. It impacted funds from operations for the second quarter of       in particular.,0.1835406282916665,NEUTRAL
Cash  capital expenditures decreased    as we were forced by COVID related restrictions to defer some of our planned spending  and as we focused on the most value enhancing activities within our core gas operations. Increased funds from operations combined with lower CapEx allowed us to achieve four positive results.,0.05000932631082833,NEUTRAL
First off  we generated approximately     million in free cash flow before interest. Secondly  we maintained our quarterly dividend declaring approximately     million to shareholders. Third  we applied approximately    million to the repurchase of shares  and lastly  we increased our holdings of cash and cash equivalents by approximately     million.,0.011715656612068415,NEUTRAL
Our dividend currently represents an annual yield of approximately  .   with the last quarterly dividend paid in January  and the next one due to be paid on April         . Our year end net debt position of approximately      million was effectively unchanged from a year-ago. As we announced in August  we were able to reprofile our credit facilities during      to substantially lower our cost of debt -- our cost of debt capital. Thanks to lower interest rates.,0.03303411044180393,NEUTRAL
While increasing the financial flexibility  we have to invest in strategic growth projects including the Medellin pipeline and El Tesorito power plant projects. Our net debt to EBITDAX ratio is reduced from  . x at December          to  .  x at December           well inside covenant limits. We continue to plan to pay down our debt in due course rather than building up large cash balances  but we ll do so strategically to minimize our finance expenses while we maintain our financial flexibility and our ability to continue investing in our business and buying back shares when it makes sense to do so.,0.017522198148071766,NEUTRAL
Focusing on the fourth quarter of     . Financial highlights include  revenues net of transportation royalties decreased    to     million compared to     million for the same period in       mainly due to a    decline in sales volumes  which was due to reduce gas demand resulting from the gas market still not being fully recovered from COVID related weakness in Q .,-0.2292291761841625,NEUTRAL
Adjusted funds flow from operations increased    to     million from     million in      as lower revenues were more than offset by lower G A expenses and cash taxes. EBITDAX increased    to     million from     million. Our cash position increased     to     million from     million  and net income decreased     to    million from     million. That year-over-year decline in net income is largely attributable to a deferred tax expense of     million in Q        compared to a deferred tax gain of     million in the comparable quarter in     .,-0.003153417259454727,NEUTRAL
Focusing solely on       we see a simple trend we view as more important when we look at revenues  funds from operations and EBITDAX  all steadily recovering from the lows seen in Q       at the height of the COVID first wave in Colombia. As Charle already highlighted in his opening statement  we have reported that monthly sales volumes continued to recover in January and February  so we re optimistic that this trend will continue throughout     .,0.09531026426702738,NEUTRAL
Our operating netback was unchanged at   .   per Mcf in the   months ended December           compared to the same period in       while our operating margin declined only very slightly from     to    . These results again highlight the stability and high margin nature of our gas business.,0.21960903238505125,NEUTRAL
What wasn t shown in the preceding operating netback and margin slide is the success we ve achieved in lowering our corporate costs including G A  finance and other expenses  particularly when measured in proportion to our sales volumes in revenue. G A for the first    -- for the    months ended December          average just   .   per Mcf      lower than the   .   per Mcf for the prior year.,0.04747682623565197,NEUTRAL
To further highlight the strength and stability as well as growth that we see in our business and financial results  we want to highlight the return on capital employed -- implied by our financial statements over the last eight quarters. The COVID pandemic curtailed the positive trajectory  our return on capital employed was showing a year ago  but our return on capital employed remains very high by E P standards at     on average for the full year       up from     in     . And quarterly results are now demonstrating a clearly positive trend that we are optimistic will continue as we move forward.,0.19809899700339884,NEUTRAL
In closing  our Q  financial results were strong and relatively stable  despite the challenges that the coronavirus pandemic presented. And we are now in an increasingly enviable position of financial strength with an ability to easily maintain a steady return to shareholders and increased flexibility to ramp up investment levels when we think it makes sense to do so. And if operational restrictions don t prevent us from doing so.,0.2517060578102246,POSITIVE
At this point  I ll hand it back to Charle. Thank you  everyone.,0.42039218405261636,POSITIVE

Thanks  Jason. Our results for the fourth quarter of      showed positive impact to our investments in growth and return to a slightly more normal operating environment in gas market. Our results for the full year demonstrate the long-term stability provided by our business model  including our fixed take-or-pay gas sales contracts.,0.47074843217706075,POSITIVE
For       despite the impact of COVID-   lingering in the short-term  we are optimistic we will continue to see demand and related sales volumes and pricing gradually strengthened  allowing us to report continued growth in sales volumes revenues and funds from operations.,0.10383045836351812,NEUTRAL
We therefore expect to remain well-positioned to continue returning capital to shareholders  while reducing our leverage ratios and investing for growth. Although the pandemic is not over  we are progressing our drilling program with two rigs currently drilling at the Milano   exploration well in the Ca ahuate   development well. And a total of    wells planned for the year  with   of those wells being exploration wells are drilling and seismic programs for this year has a significant focus on exploration to support long-term production growth.,0.036301885498687625,NEUTRAL
In addition to investing in drilling and seismic to allow us to grow production reserves over the long-term  we are working diligently to progress important strategic process -- projects that will support increased transportation capacity and demand for our gas  such as Medellin pipeline  and the El Tesorito power plant project.,0.047863684318144806,NEUTRAL
And of course  in order to build a sustainable business  we will seek further continuous improvement in our strategy and execution as it relates to all ESG matters. Given currently prevailing optimism around COVID-   incident rates  hospitalizations and vaccines as well as the positive dynamics we see taking place in Colombia s gas market is probably worth reminding you that we could yet look at investing beyond our base budget program as indicated in our guidance press release in December.,0.06657427328173071,NEUTRAL
Conversely  if gas demand were again impacted by a third or fourth wave of COVID related restrictions  we maintain flexibility in our capital program to adjust accordingly. I d like to thank the entire Canacol team as well as our contractors  partners and clients for their support and hard work during this challenging year that      was  and with somewhat uncertain times that continue as we seek to return to more normal operating conditions.,0.0672446796670556,NEUTRAL

Thank you. We have a first question from Alejandro Demichelis from Nau Securities. Alejandro is asking  could you please comment how you see the situation with the fracking pilot ,0.3260268688900396,POSITIVE
Charle Gamba,-0.00041638215770944953,NEUTRAL
Yes. As you know  Ecopetrol is preparing to execute a fracking pilot  a non-conventional pilot for oil in the middle of Magdalena Valley. And ExxonMobil recently announced that they re applying for a permit to execute a similar pilot also in the middle Magdalena Valley. So the regulatory environment at the moment is favorable for these fracking pilots. By no means does that ensure that  they will be able to execute them without difficulty  especially from the communities who remain heavily opposed to fracking from an environmental perspective.,-0.010035192593932152,NEUTRAL
These pilots are non-commercial pilots  or they are not intended to establish commercial production. As a matter of fact  these pilots do not have any commercial terms associated with them. They re simply designed to apply typical massive hydraulic fracturing techniques here in Colombia  and monitor the impact of those operations on the environment  specifically  groundwater  micro tremors  etcetera.

Hey  Josef. Yes  El Tesorito is on schedule basically. I mean  it s the civil works has started there and the licenses are all in order. The motors have all been commissioned  and in the process of fabrication in Europe. The start date is estimated between December and February. December of this year and February of next year. So that seems to be moving ahead smoothly. With respect to potential sales volumes  there remains a deficit still in the electrical market related to the delay of Ituango hydroelectric project. So there s a       megawatt deficit in the hydro space. So the forecast is that our cash repo will be generated between     and     capacity would translate between    million to    million cubic feet per day of sales when it starts up.,0.012118058279156685,NEUTRAL

Jason Bednar,0.00041906023398041725,NEUTRAL
Yes  that s a very good question. This relates directly to a deferred tax write-down we did in Q . So in late       a Council of State Court ruling essentially disallowed the use of losses on merge companies. So the particular case that was in front of the court at that point in time was not an oil and gas case. And it had different facts  circumstances than the Canacol case. It s probably important to note that the DN  ph  has yet to change the tax laws to reflect that particular court s ruling. So as you can imagine that has affected many companies  and many challenges to that ruling are expected in the near future  with Canacol being one of those challenges. So many experts believe the ruling is unconstitutional. And it was due to the ambiguity surrounding that ruling that we do recognize the deferred tax assets on our balance sheets.,-0.04761870577931404,NEUTRAL
Having said that  if -- should Canacol or any other company proved successful in any challenge  which we believe some will be heard within the first    months  we would be able to use those     million of losses in the year where we are successful or someone else is successful. I should note that it was that particular court only disallowed certain tax losses in that particular case. So  we re hopeful that we will get that back and obviously we re working with local experts via constitution or tax wise on that particular topic. But we ended with    -- at the end of the year with     million in cash. We ve got a     million revolving line of credit that is untouched  and our budgets would not be looking to touch that.

Yes  thank you  James. Yes  as we continue to add more fields to our production mix  we tend to back off production and some of the other fields to lower the production in order to capture as much reserves as we can  as we sort of lower the production from the big producing fields and as we bring on new fields. But in general  we ve been shifting our exploration away from Esperanza  which are where Nelson and Palmer are located and where we did our first exploration       years ago. We ve been shifting more and more exploration activity into VIM-   which is where Clarinete and Pandereta are located.

Of course  you always expect a meaningful step-up from February to March. And so  it s good to see some traditional seasonality starting to come out.

As Ed said  we ve made some great progress here at the end of March  really for the last five or six weeks  we ve seen a very different trajectory in terms of forward bookings. As the US case counts came down from their late January peak  and vaccinations continued to run out in the marketplace. So we ve seen what we would consider to be a lot of pent-up demand for primarily domestic and short-haul international leisure travel.,0.027172401547431946,MIXED
This past week  digital shopping for   as a forward looking marker  were     restored to our      levels and that s up nearly    points from December.

And that s really to talk a little bit about that  that s very different from anywhere else that we ve been in the pandemic with   the further out bookings now starting to come in.,0.20875804405659437,POSITIVE
The one thing that was consistent throughout the entire pandemic was the compression of the booking window were inside of    and inside of six days  where most of your bookings resided. And really in the past six weeks  we ve seen that move out  so that bookings that are beyond    days are almost flat to      levels  just down a few points. And that s a very different situation from where we ve been in the last year  so very encouraging signs there.,-0.24181343894451857,NEGATIVE

But we do expect that from all the surveys that we ve seen out in the marketplace that that will continue to accelerate with many people returning to the office late in  Q or early in  Q.

We have  of course not yet released our middle seat. Our middle seat block is still in place. And that is going to be an incredibly powerful tool. If you think that we were able to get to cash breakeven in the month of March with over     of our inventory that s out flying not being sold  as demand continues to return. And as we release those seats into the future  that s going to be an incredibly strong lever for us with very minimal cost open those seats up.,0.25947678461670876,POSITIVE
So I think  where we re sitting right now is a very different place than where we were sitting last we spoke  and one that we re very encouraged with and one that we see signs across the board. I would say  the one thing that s still the wild card is the long-haul international and when that will open up and we ve been working very hard as you know  we have several corridors open for quarantine pre-travel to Europe  which are doing quite well.,0.16367759183049202,POSITIVE
But while we re doing very well in the US right now with case counts continuing to decline and vaccinations continuing to accelerate  that s not the case all over the world yet. So we think that s going to be a spotty return. And hopefully  we can get towards late summer a reopening of the Transatlantic  which would be the next thing we really need to achieve here. So lots of encouraging signs  but lots of room to grow and lots of room to continue to improve as we move through spring.,0.06797885429114103,MIXED

Since the beginning of the pandemic  one of the things that has really enabled the U.S. airline industry to emerge from this crisis as relatively strong  bruised  but relatively strong is we ve been able to get out compared to the airline industry in any other part of the world  really has been the support of congress  the administration or elected officials  both previous administration  the current Biden administration  we do really appreciate the support that we ve received from them.,0.18443012982606888,POSITIVE

And in the June quarter  we expect to -- it  isn t   ph  a normal amortization of debt  which includes the      million of un-security maturity that s due in April. We plan on acquiring aircraft with cash and accelerating up to    billion or potentially even a bit more of voluntary contributions into our pension plans.,-0.012085096910595894,NEUTRAL
So as you can see  the balance sheet recovery is back in full earnest at Delta. We know the strength of our balance sheet is one of the things that enabled us to manage through the worst crisis in our industry without having to dilute our shareholders. It s something that has set us apart within the industry and we re already starting down the path to recover the balance sheet. We look forward to getting those investment grade ratings back here over the next couple of years.,0.16034534107893705,NEUTRAL
So while the last year has been incredibly difficult for everyone in our industry  probably has been one of the poster child s for that degree of difficulty I ve said many times through this crises that crisis reveals character and could not be more proud of the character of the people of Delta Airlines  the values that we show in terms of taking care of our people and our customers and positioning us well for what I consider year two of the pandemic  which is for us year one of the recovery  which starts in earnest this month.,-0.004838577471673489,MIXED
With that Jamie  we ll turn it back to you and Mark and pleased to take any questions. Thank you.,0.4887215717753861,POSITIVE
By the way  I do -- before I do that  one other thing I want to mention that in addition to Jill s retirement and Julie Abley taking on Jill s shoes  we ve also made the announcement to promote Ken Morge as Senior Vice President  Finance and Treasurer. Ken has been a stalwart through this -- for many years  but particularly through this last year. He was probably the most important person at Delta   indiscernible  for many  many  days within the last year at Delta  and really appreciate all the good work that Ken has done. So thank you  Ken for your work and great to see you get a well deserved promotion.,0.46507449669297785,POSITIVE

Q - Jamie Baker,0.00012956831778865308,NEUTRAL
Alright  that s great. Thank you  gentlemen. First question for Glen. Your good friend  Paul Jacobson in the past spoke about a profitable cohabitation with ultra low cost carriers  but these airlines are undoubtedly emboldened by the downturn. We ve got some startups in the wings. They re the tip of the recovery sphere  because they are all leisure  they don t have corporate or international networks to worry about. How does the pandemic change the domestic interplay between operating models  And why shouldn t we assume that discounters emerge with more share and Delta with less ,-0.042971864342689514,NEGATIVE
Glen Hauenstein,0.0002539715787861496,NEUTRAL
Well  you know  I think that  we re not playing a share game. We re playing a profit game. And we re very  very secure in our offerings. And I think when you think about what our objective has been through the pandemic  it has continued to offer best-in-class  no matter what your travel needs are. And I d say one of the things that we all will work on as we continue to release the seats  or as we look to release the seats towards the summer is that  we will have more seats in the lower fare categories.,0.15791929885745049,NEUTRAL
And I think when you look at  what some of our objectives were going through the pandemic was to make sure we came out stronger and that in the places that we chose to compete that  we did not see share. And I think when you look at how we ve done even with this seat block in all of our core hubs  we have maintained the share levels at pre-pandemic levels. And we think that will serve as well as we continue to move towards the back end of this and   and are able to put the full level of inventory back in play here.,0.2531795622780919,POSITIVE
So I do see that  a lot of them think that they had a great opportunity there. But the other thing that we ve been working on through the pandemic is improving our fleet mix. And you know  that peaceful cohabitation that Paul described was when we are able to put our large stage equipment up against them  some of our highest margins are directly against your LCC  in LCC market. So that s another piece that we ve accelerated in the pandemic. So I think we re going to come through as I mentioned earlier  stronger than ever.,0.0023067835718393326,MIXED
Jamie Baker,0.0005737742030760273,NEUTRAL
Okay. Well  let s bring Ed into that conversation because the initial market view several months ago was that  Delta and the industry would not return to prior margin levels  given due to corporate demand  higher debt levels and so forth. Obviously  the markets view is far more optimistic today. But what level of confidence do you have that Delta cannot only return to but exceed your prior margins and what are the primary drivers there ,-0.06783924158662558,MIXED
Ed Bastian,0.000526320880453568,NEUTRAL
Well  Jimmy I agree. I   our goal is to not just get back to the margins of our business  but to exceed them. I think we ve got a real   a real good path to do that. When you think about three of the core ingredients to that first of all  the strength of our customer interactions  the strength of our brand  arguably has never been stronger. As we ve gone through the pandemic  we ve seen a full    point increase in Net Promoter Scores. Our Net Promoter Scores are in the    range.,0.4066886065993458,POSITIVE
And that was one of the reasons and   and that s despite the fact that we were blocking those seats or maybe because in some cases  but you saw the premium that we were also receiving on the revenue front through that crisis. I think we   over the course of the last -- the last couple of quarters  we ve generated more passenger revenue compared to our main competitors  despite the fact that we had significantly fewer seats available for sale  that really strengthens the proposition of the Delta brand.,-0.14782878011465073,NEGATIVE
I can t tell you  every single day  I get notes from customers thanking us for how we treat them. And by the way  it s not just the middle seat block  that s been a part of it. But it s really been the great work our team has done throughout that. So I think we re entering through this with a stronger brand and more differentiated brand.,0.4808125195559114,POSITIVE
We re going to come through this with a streamlined cost structure. We ve retired     of our oldest planes  we ve got another     planes that we re going to be accelerating the retirement of that those efficiencies that we re going to   we re going to garner from that  we ve looked at   our staffing were down about     in overall headcount because of the early retirement arrangements. And we ve had to be pretty creative than how we ve managed our cost. Our costs have been down close to     throughout the pandemic  and there s a lot that we ve gained from that. The one thing that I   it s going to take a little bit of time to repair is that   is that balance sheet strength.,0.0424470417201519,MIXED
So  the higher debt load  but we re going to come through it in pretty  pretty good state. The investments we re making in our pension  as I talked about  they re going to help us in that regard also improve  improve the reduction of debt and the improved performance of the pension assets.,0.22975071519613266,NEUTRAL
But I think the one area that is maybe more important than any of that is international performance. When we think about how we re coming through this. We re arguably as an industry  the US industry coming through this on an international basis in a much stronger way than any country  I can think of around the world.,0.1489425264298916,NEUTRAL
The landscape is different. The strength of our partnerships are going to be the   even more important to us. And I think the area  Delta had the greatest opportunity to improve pre-pandemic was in our international margins. And I see no reason why our international margins can t go viable  our domestic margins  as we come through this over the next couple of years.,0.1835944438353181,NEUTRAL
Jamie Baker,0.0005737742030760273,NEUTRAL
And a quick follow-up on that before cutting over to Mark. First  what is that or what was that margin lag going into the downturn  We have that number from United. Please refresh my memory for Delta.,-0.03230508416891098,NEUTRAL
And then Ed  you also   you speak about the brand. Was there anything about the brand that emerged differently during the downturn than what you expected and any disappointment relative to your thoughts on the brand ,-0.3112603183835745,NEGATIVE
Ed Bastian,0.000526320880453568,NEUTRAL
I ll take the second question first. No  I don t think so. One of the things that  I ve been really impressed with the brand  not only in terms of customers  behavior and commitment to the brand  and again  a lot of the customers that were traveling were not our primary  most are loyal customers. So that to me was the most important thing.,0.14643338322639465,POSITIVE
So this was not a strongly loyal Delta base travelers. It s a business travelers or premium travelers. This was largely a price seekers that were   that d have been out in the market for the last year  and yet our brand still stood strong through that period.,-0.32834031619131565,NEGATIVE
One of the areas we also look as our co-brands spend with American Express. Our co-brands spend is held in total  up really well as with Steve Squeri  a few days ago. And I think on a year-over-year basis we re down less than     on a year-over-year basis in terms of what Amex is seeing in terms of total co-brand spend on the Delta Card  largely because of T E being down in such a material way.,0.019057519733905792,NEUTRAL
If you look at the non-T E categories  our co-brand spend is actually up. So  as consumers are spending more  they re continuing to invest in the Delta brand  using Amex. So I think holistically  there s nothing about the brand  I d say   as I stand back and say was disappointed.,-0.4672693940810859,NEGATIVE
On the margins  Gary is in the room. He can comment on the margins. Relative to the US margins  Europe is closest. I think the US and the European margins or Europe s not too far behind where we are in the US. Both Latin America and Asia  we re probably five to    points lower than domestic margins. Gary  you can correct me  if I misspoken that.,0.024111606180667877,NEUTRAL

No. You got it.,-0.29379625618457794,NEGATIVE
Jamie Baker,0.0005737742030760273,NEUTRAL
And as a follow-up on that  we ll get to you eventually Mark  I promise. But  and this is probably for Glen  on that international point. How should we think about future Latin American profitability  post bankruptcy for LatAm and Aerom xico  What does that mean for the JV and Delta s results in that region ,-0.09077955782413483,NEUTRAL
Glen Hauenstein,0.0002539715787861496,NEUTRAL
Look  it is not only in Latin America  but all over the world. As Ed said earlier  our international partners have not received the support from their respective governments the U.S. carriers have received from there. And that has led to a rash of bankruptcies and consolidations across the map.,-0.3709260248579085,NEGATIVE
And I think  how we look at this is that  our partners will emerge stronger  and our ability to connect with our partners will -- across the globe will allow us to have higher returns moving forward. And so  what you seen is  the weakest of the week have either restructured or gone away depending on the entity and will not be coming back with the amount of capacity or with the ferocious appetite for growth that they had in the past.,0.06604045210406184,NEUTRAL
So I think whether you re looking at Latin or whether you re looking at Trans-Atlantic  or even in the Trans-Pacific  we re emerging from this in a very different position than we were going in. And as Ed said  when you combine that with our fleet improvements internationally with the fleet renewal that we ve been working on through the pandemic  I think you can easily see where we can make significant improvements in every region with our partners and with our new fleet as we emerge from this. So  very exciting time for us.,0.3499255361966789,POSITIVE
Jamie Baker,0.0005737742030760273,NEUTRAL
And picking up on that  Glen  you said the magic words fleet  and as you touched on it a little bit too  it was    months ago on the April call where Delta and the airline industry was at DEFCON    you sent a very strong message to Airbus  and to investors that you weren t taking any aircraft. And by the end of the year  you were back talking about the great partnership that you have with Airbus on the fleet renewal and so forth.,0.1817366722971201,NEUTRAL
So I m wondering that if we can do just a little postmortem on sort of the cadence  if you will  the thought process there on the fleet renewal versus where we were a year ago  versus where we are now. How you re thinking about that  and how you re thinking about ESG  which I think is post pandemic  obviously  one of the biggest issues that we re all facing as stakeholders here in the airline industry ,-0.18532018642872572,NEUTRAL
Glen Hauenstein,0.0002539715787861496,NEUTRAL
Like I said  not only Airbus  but Boeing have been great partners over the course of this past year. And you re right  in the throes of the virus  I was looking at some numbers the other day that on April   -- now that our TSA count as an industry are back over   million a day and rising  April    or so was about the low point  which I think is when we had that earnings call in the first quarter. I think the TSA count for the industry was        people  it s just stunning. So  yes  in the throes of that  we suspended not just deliveries and payments of aircraft  but just about everything that we could find.,-0.2021835669875145,NEGATIVE
But as we ve worked through the course of the year  we did a very good job of being able to retain our positions with Airbus  we slid the book to the right by a couple of years  as I think you re aware  and maintain the commitments  but that s what partners do. And we ve worked creatively.,0.4853194974712096,POSITIVE
We continue to be taking the narrowbody aircraft fleet. We took over the -- in the latter part of the year  last year the    -     launched a new fleet for us  it s doing well in the mix. And as we look forward  a big  big part of our recovery is they continue to upgauge with more domestic network  which is going to be predicated on the Airbus    s that we will continue to take as we eliminated many  many of our -- large number  the     aircraft I talked about that retired over the last year  were small domestic narrowbody  smaller gauged aircraft.,0.029188044369220734,NEUTRAL
So we continue to look opportunistically as to where there may be opportunities and some may be out there  as orders have shifted from other carriers as well. When people ask me if we re talking Airbus and Boeing  we talked to those guys every single day. Good times and bad  by the way.,-0.13155155256390572,MIXED
Jamie Baker,0.0005737742030760273,NEUTRAL
And when we think about the carbon agenda and how you think about the environment. How does that fit in with fleet right now and have you -- I mean  pre-pandemic  we ve had some conversations about the old Delta  the Old Northwest  certainly  right would run planes into the ground  running forever  and so forth. And there seem definitely to be a shift towards renewing the fleet even before we were in the pandemic. Obviously  I m just sort of wondering  right now  on the carbon side  how the fleet renewal fits in with that ,-0.08021935075521469,NEUTRAL
Ed Bastian,0.000526320880453568,NEUTRAL
Well  it does. One of the silver linings of the pandemic was that we were able to retire many of those old airplanes that you that you referred to. In       on a per seat basis  our total fuel burn was down    on a year-over-year basis over     . So  that s a big number. And that s a number that we see entering       because a lot of that burn was we received over the course of the latter parts of     .,0.0424099899828434,MIXED
So  historically  we ve been running about a  .   to    efficiency on a year-over-year basis. We tripled that in      and that s not due to lower volume  that s just due to the actual seats that we were flying. And I see in      us continuing to make good progress. I can see when we get towards the end of      versus       that number could be as high as     that we are -- we ve improved our fuel efficiency over this period of time.,0.27928775921463966,POSITIVE
So  those opportunities are real  every plane that we take on the domestic narrowbody side  whether it s the    s  the    s are coming in about     more fuel efficient than the plane that we re retiring.,0.06181180290877819,NEUTRAL
Glen Hauenstein,0.0002539715787861496,NEUTRAL
And just to clarify  while you re right about      as a whole  if you look in the fourth quarter where the fleet restructuring had a more complete impact  our fuel efficiency entr e at some basis is up    . We expect numbers like that to continue in the first and second quarter. So  it s having a big impact. Huge progress.,0.25939588667824864,POSITIVE

Jamie Baker,0.0005737742030760273,NEUTRAL
Yeah. So  on the corporate demand question  which is probably the biggest overhang at the moment  I think it was on the fourth quarter call that you disclosed that half of your customers expect to get back to normal. I think it was    expect to never get back to normal  and then something around level -- the rest     sort of falling into that undecided category.,-0.48274011036846787,NEGATIVE
I m curious what J.P. Morgan s answer was to that question  though  I don t expect you to know it.

What I think we re going to say is that the intensive travel is continuing to move forward. We ve seen since the start of the year intensive travelers up about    points on the backs of the improvement in the containment of the virus vaccinations continue to move  the fact that the country become more people vaccinated than actually have having actually had positive diagnosis of the virus is an important data point.,0.1438406314700842,NEUTRAL
And companies are starting to see their signs for is how they re reopening their businesses and starting to get back to whatever the new -- the next normal is as we look forward to. I think the numbers will be better than that. That      will have more insight.

Ed Bastian,0.000526320880453568,NEUTRAL
Well  I think the most will have proven their strength and their durability  the resilience over the course pandemic as we get old get a little bit further ahead of this as we get into the spring and summer and see what the recovery actually materializes and how it looks.

We know the strength of our people has been powerful.,0.433231289149262,POSITIVE
Generally  one of the things that we talked a lot about in those modes is culture. The culture of our company  the culture of our people  and while our net promoter scores and our brand scores are at all time highs for various reasons  I think that the most important reason is  the great work our team has done  taking care of people  pulling anxiety as they get through the travel experience  smiling with your eyes through a mask. I mean  it s the experiences is really unique about Delta and has never been better.,0.43863674119347706,POSITIVE

So we talked about strength and culture and brand health and employee health is amazing going through a pandemic and we re rated the seventh best employer amongst large employers.

Yes. Of course. I mean we did describe our      performance as one that had some out-performance related to market circumstances. That were not easy to replicate. And yet  we also were very clear in our Investor Day in December that we saw a substantial portion of that out-performance actually being resilient and sustained and sustainable into future years. And I think what we re seeing right now is exactly that strategy playing out. So it s early to tell how the full      will play out  but clearly  we re very encouraged by this start of the year in the business. Also  because we see the performance  like I said  not focused on one particular business only  but distributed across our franchises  and that s true for LDCM  for the DCM franchise  obviously  for ECM  as well as in FIC.,0.371618450852111,POSITIVE
I think it speaks to not just the momentum in the Investment Bank  but the fact that we have our core businesses really having shown great resilience last year and carrying resilience into this year. And it speaks to a certain amount of positive momentum that the bank is experiencing. And we expect that momentum not to abate due to seasonality  but in fact  to continue strongly. So notwithstanding the fact that some of our businesses obviously do experience seasonality  but the indicators we get  the pipelines  the activity  the volumes of inflows in those businesses in which it matters are actually quite positive. So       it s early days  but so far  things are going quite well. And in fact  as I just told you  Investment Bank  better than well.,0.32962091639637947,POSITIVE

Perfect. Thank you very much. Very  very encouraging. Now let s kind of look into the transformation of the bank. You ve kind of   you ve mentioned a little bit offered on the Investment Banking side kind of already. But you re in the job for    months. So what are your kind of key takeaways kind of so far  The greatest challenges  particularly last year  and particularly at the backdrop of the pandemic.,0.493001851515146,POSITIVE
Fabrizio Campelli,0.01143430545926094,NEUTRAL
Yes. I have been in the job for    months. And the job was established to actually support the consequent execution of our strategy. We announced a strategy in July     . Shortly thereafter  the Transformation Office was set up. And the purpose was really to give us that systematic focus on executing on a strategy  which was predicated on focusing on businesses in which we wanted to compete to win. The execution clearly has gone to our plan in     . And I think it has been the result of a number of ingredients. A lot of effort that has gone into the preparation of the strategy  and the Transformation Office there has contributed to creating the structure around it. I spoke bit about it at the investor detail. We ve broken the executional strategy down into    initiatives  about    key deliverables      milestones. We monitor     risk      dependencies between initiatives. It s to create structure and to mitigate the risk of the execution of those long-term strategic building blocks of our execution in any way to go off-track.,0.32838407694362104,POSITIVE
We also built a lot of mechanisms as part of the Transformation Office to stay on track on shorter-term measures  and in a way that would allow us to stay focused on the long-term priorities  but also respond tactically to short-term challenges. Little did we know when we set the office up that way  that COVID would really force us into a lot of these short-term management of difficulty. But things have gone particularly well in      because we have been able to stick to the long-term priorities. As I indicated at the end of the year in our Investor Day  over     of our milestones were met  over      of the custom   that we were targeting to reduce as part of the key deliverables of the specific transformation initiatives were achieved. And so the program is clearly delivering its goals. And on the short term  more tactical measures  we ve also been able to support the bank quite proactively in countering the effects of the crisis  which clearly did have an impact on our ability to execute.,0.2510750270448625,POSITIVE
And there were some challenges. Think about  for example  where in the spring  we announced that we had to put a restructuring on hold  not to plunge our employees into what was at that point in time an untenable uncertainty. And when we did that  we had to found countermeasures to stay on track on costs  as we did because we did end up closing the years at a    .  billion of cost.,-0.30751356249675155,NEGATIVE
I have to say  a very important aspect of this was really creating  and then riding on the positive momentum that was good generated within DB. I think the whole market in      and in      has seen some things that have supported  particularly banks with our business model. But what was specific about Deutsche Bank is that  that momentum we saw from employees  from our clients has really supported us into making these changes. And we see the momentum being stronger now than it was just a year ago. And the measure of that is  when we call our employees      of our staff stands behind the strategy  understands what we re trying to do  and they are actively supporting it.,0.3859036916401237,POSITIVE
And those are the kind of small things that make a difference. This is the difference between two  three years ago  the effort that was put into these transformation measures  and now seeing our clients starting at seven in the morning  making those phone calls until late at night  supporting us to execute on what we want to do. And an example of that is also in Germany. The standing of the bank  the feedback we get from our retail and commercial banks   sorry  commercial clients in Germany is at a   -year high on what we are receiving.,0.0809403769671917,NEUTRAL
And again  showing that   the big effort and the heavy lifting that has happened in the past years is starting to pay off in the results that Deutsche Bank is showing. So my job was also to channel a lot of this energy  keep us organized  come up with new ideas. And we intend to carry that momentum firmly into      and     .,0.3796542782802135,POSITIVE

Perfect. At the investment  kind of deep dive in December  you ve also announced a partnership with Google. And could you just elaborate what are the benefits of it  And how should we think about it from the perspective of financial impact  Is it a net positive kind of on the revenue side  Is it net negative on the cost short term because of the  I suppose  upfront Investment  Could you give us a sense of what s happening there ,0.37674130545929074,POSITIVE
Fabrizio Campelli,0.01143430545926094,NEUTRAL
Sure. The Google partnership we signed  which made us the primary financial partner to Google and is actually designed to actually play right into the spirit of the transformation I outlined. Transformation  we always   we often think about it being a cost play  when in reality for DB  it s a revenue growth play  a cost play  a culture play. And on the cost side  I mentioned a few examples. But on the revenue side as well  we are really aiming to build momentum around our growth  particularly by harvesting more of this cross-divisional capability  which are  in turn  built on deepening and leveraging better our client relationships  and the Google partnership plays right there.,0.15401500649750233,NEUTRAL
So we have signed this partnership with the three fundamental objectives in mind. The first one is to really change the way we develop technology going forward at Deutsche Bank. And the spirit there  Bernd has been quite open about it in his speech in   at investor event in December. The spirit there is to change the way we develop our applications and using better technology that Google can make available to us in the way we architect  develop and use technological infrastructure to get to a more flexible  better architect and more scalable  safer set of technology and application solutions to clients faster.,0.18818123076925986,NEUTRAL
The second part is innovation. Because  thanks to a joint recruiting of engineers  the co-creation of solutions  we will be able to develop applications and make them available to clients in ways that were not possible before to us alone. And the third part actually is a cost effectiveness play because we are effectively moving to a much more variable cost base. If you think about it  we move from a world in which we would buy and use our infrastructure to actually having  thanks to the hyperscale model  a model in which we pay for what we use.,0.1960398843511939,NEUTRAL
And all of this will actually contribute to making us more innovative  better client responsive  and obviously  enhance growth  and come up with new products and new ideas that will make revenue solutions to our clients and reaching new clients possible  and over time  also achieve a higher level of cost efficiency. We re talking about a   .  year partnership we have signed. So the time horizon for many of these benefits will distribute over that period of time. And they play right into the spirit of making the strategy of Deutsche Bank a long-term one and making us sustainably profitable and competitive in the long-term.,0.21522128308424726,NEUTRAL
Magdalena Stoklosa,0.0003911633975803852,NEUTRAL
Brilliant. Because that actually leads me to a couple of cost questions. And I think before I go into those cost questions  I think you ll be   you ll be pleased to know that our poll has closed and the highest answer to the share price question  almost     is still continuing cost delivery. So no pressure on the cost questions. So of course  you ve lowered your      cost target. And what do you see as the contribution of the Transformation Office here ,0.4770930811064318,POSITIVE
Fabrizio Campelli,0.01143430545926094,NEUTRAL
Well  we did see very strong momentum on costs. And we have often spoken about the   th consecutive quarter of adjusted cost reductions. And again  that shows a very thoughtful execution of how we intend to go about the delivery of the efficiency  which is one of the core tenets of the Compete To Win strategy we have announced. And we intend to keep driving that into      and     .,0.4436211984138936,POSITIVE
I think the further reduction of our target  from     billion to    .  billion in       and   obviously reflects the fact that as a team  we continue to see opportunities to harvest on investment made to date  investments we are continuing to make in     . And obviously  we are contributing with some of those ideas. And I described some of them. If you think about how the Transformation Office is playing into this  we look at adding and catalyzing new ideas  building on the cost catalyst initiative that James von Moltke started a few years ago and continuing to drive new thoughts. And some of these are relatively small  like a more consistent use of tools and workflow tools to optimize our expenses.,0.13702630391344428,NEUTRAL
For example  when it comes to our vendor professional service expenses  some are medium-sized and larger size. We have been speaking about end-to-end process re-engineering as a mechanism by which we can     million of incremental cost in      by using artificial intelligence technology partners that enable us to much faster engineering of end-to-end processes. And some are more fundamental  more transformative  like   as the shift of attention is focusing from cost reduction in the businesses to infrastructure  as much of the heavy lifting in the business has already occurred  a much higher focus on end-to-end process realignment and the re-architecting from front-to-back perspective becomes a big enabler of further savings.,0.0031370343640446663,NEUTRAL
So if you think about it  the big blocks  we re targeting a   .  billion of compensation   so compensation and benefits reductions as we continue to reduce our workforce costs       million or so of IT cost reductions that come from a number of measures from application decommissioning to more efficient application development. And there continues to be focus on those professional service costs that we are optimizing in terms of how we relate to our vendors.,0.0106202382594347,NEUTRAL
Our COO  Frank Kuhnke  has worked hard on optimizing those costs  and we expect another      million or so of costs. Incrementally  we re looking at new ideas that cover  for example  an optimized use of our space  and an incremental      million or so is being targeted in     . And it will be facilitated by a number of measures we ve made  which include  for example  the consolidation of campuses in London and New York. We re moving our footprint to new and more efficient buildings which will help us reduce the overall cost target in     .,0.0907581047504209,NEUTRAL
So overall  we remain confident in those. And this is countering also other effects that we re seeing. And for example  when it comes to single resolution fund  based on latest guidance  we are getting from the SRB. We are expecting in       at least  an increase to the funding of the similar solution fund relative to our assumptions. And so we expect in       the charges to be to be closer to the level they were last year  so just under      million.,-0.006868500262498856,MIXED
Magdalena Stoklosa,0.0003911633975803852,NEUTRAL
Perfect. And then  Fabrizio  you gave us some of the numbers  but let s kind of simply come back to some kind of yearly staging of your cost declines. Because  of course  your cost trajectory kind of looks like a hockey stick. So we ve got    billion in     . Of course  at the same time  with all necessary investments. We ve got    billion cost cuts in     . Now can you kind of talk to us about your level of confidence that  that      cost target  that    .  billion  is   I mean how difficult is it to achieve  Because in real   in absolute numbers  these are big saves.,0.264337457716465,POSITIVE
Fabrizio Campelli,0.01143430545926094,NEUTRAL
Yes. Magdalena  I would point to one thing  which is I wouldn t really see it as a hockey stick in the sense that  from      end of      to end of       we reduced costs by   .  billion on an adjusted basis. And between end of        to end of      is now only   .  billion left. So in a way  we have already   if anything is an inverse of that we ve done the heavy lifting upfront  and we re now benefiting from the enormous effort that has gone into previous years.,-0.008270688354969025,MIXED
We said very clearly  I think James has also provided some transparency on this  that in       we decided to accelerate some of the investments that will help us make      and beyond more efficient. For example  we transparently show that in       we decided to invest an incremental      million on the integration of our German IT platform. And this is an investment that will give us a benefit into       but into      and beyond  it will be an even larger investment.,0.24004392401548102,NEUTRAL
We decided to invest more through the use of the driver based cost management in the reduction of the stranded cost into our Capital Release Unit  which is why our   from the original assumption of approximately    billion  the Capital Release Unit stranded cost expected at the end of      have now dropped to      million. But thanks to the investment we re making this year  it would also carry momentum into      and beyond. So overall  I would say  we have a strong conviction  obviously  into our      targets. The    .  billion remains absolutely the number we are committed to. And we see and we have a strong plan on how to achieve that  which is predicated on not just the work done so far.,0.21806534158531576,NEUTRAL
The fact that many of the initiatives we have carried out in      and      will run rate into future years  and so will help us get there. But also  because we continue to replenish the book with new ideas  that s what my office is also very heavily involved in  which is giving us a comfort that the plan we have  we intend to navigate with the same discipline that we have shown for the last three years with kind of the intent to continue the last    quarters of meeting or exceeding promises on costs to be maintained for the next three quarters.,0.17544839857146144,MIXED

Fabrizio  let s move a little bit forward because  of course  when we originally spoke about  of course  the strategy back in     .      just seemed very far away. And of course        now it s just kind of next year  and we ve talked about your   the confidence in that    .  billion target. When you kind of   when you cast your eye three years further  how should we think about a cost base that Deutsche needs to operate with ,-0.05914443917572498,MIXED
Fabrizio Campelli,0.01143430545926094,NEUTRAL
It s really important to understand. We start with the transformation  and it was healthy for many reasons to attach absolute targets to many aspects of our plan. And so that s why there was an absolute cost target laid out for us for       for       and those are serving a certain purpose. As we normalize the transformation cycle  we moved back to being a bank that can deliver and will deliver    return on tangible equity  which is what our target is as we move back to having the heavy portion of the therapy behind us  it will also be important to move back to a more relative measurement of cost efficiency.,0.08784436422865838,NEUTRAL
So we intend after       our appetite would be to move back to our cost income ratio target. And we see that for       for example  a level of     would be the level that we would target. And of course  improve from there based on a number of metrics that we can see. I mentioned earlier  we already see that for       there will be pressure upwards on cost from a number of things  but also we have a lot of measures already lined up  which will blossom only fully in     .,-0.004787161014974117,MIXED
I mentioned the stranded costs in the CRU  the full impact of having a single platform supporting the technology of our private bank in Germany. All of these will continue to generate positive momentum. But again  we will have the heavy part of transformation behind us at that point and not giving up any discipline because we will be very focused on sticking to this consequential execution of strategy. We would want to carry this momentum into      and beyond  but looking at the right balance between cost and revenues. And the     cost-to-income ratio is really what we are currently looking at as SR hypotheses.,0.030221465975046158,NEUTRAL
Magdalena Stoklosa,0.0003911633975803852,NEUTRAL
Okay. Well  that s   so let s   so of course  cost to income ratio  there s cost  there s revenues. Let s go back on to the revenue side. We talked about the strength of IB revenues. But of course  this is the kind of the second big discussion on the revenue side is  of course  the trajectory of net interest income. And you have been quite vocal over the last quarters  about a defense of the net interest income by  of course  loan growth  particularly kind of domestically in Germany  but also repricing  again  kind of corporate commercial deposits across Europe. Could you give us a sense of kind of where we are  kind of any context you can give to that kind of broad NII trajectory ,-0.14152686763554811,NEUTRAL
Fabrizio Campelli,0.01143430545926094,NEUTRAL
Sure. It has remained a very central part of our strategy to counter the negative drag of interest rates with active measures that we ve embraced in our businesses. Perhaps  let s start with the Corporate Bank. The starting point for the Corporate Bank is already quite strong  with     of the revenues there are fee income based already. So it s a pretty solid starting point. But nonetheless  we do have exposure to net interest income  and the negative interest rate environment has clearly been a challenge.,0.008813319262117147,MIXED
In that sense  Stefan Hoops and his team have done a formidable job at actually continuing to work on the conversion and the establishment of charged arrangement. And currently  we have about     billion of our accounts  which actually have a charging agreement attached to them  which has helped us really increase and enhance revenues relative to where we were at the end of      by about      million a year in that business.,0.3707779059186578,POSITIVE
And with momentum that  again  we expect to carry into      as more of that activity care   is carried out. In the private bank  focus has been on rounding out the business  and it has been done quite successfully. We have increased volumes in      of loans by about     billion of net inflows were approximately     billion in       of which    billion were actually deposit conversions. So we have achieved a good reduction of deposits  enhancement of invested assets  which obviously is good for the bank  is good for our clients.,0.29407453048042953,POSITIVE
And if you take into account the fact that we have continued on repricing activities on all of our products  we have  for example  continue to create these new accounts  over          are applied on a charge basis. This has generated approximately      million of incremental revenues for the Private Bank in      and we expect that same level of incremental revenue to continue into      as these measures continue to be applied.,0.02287396672181785,NEUTRAL
And so when you look at the growth rates expected in these businesses  it s actually looking like we are holding  for example  in the Private Bank in Germany  quite steady. But in the interest rate environment we have in Europe  steady is actually a strong performance  as shown in the performance of our retail bank in      relative to peers. That was actually quite resilient  thanks to all these measures that have been put in place.,0.3459042333997786,POSITIVE

Brilliant. Thank you. Thank you very much for that. Now let s move on to kind of onto the CRU kind of run-down path  because you ve mentioned the stranded costs  and of course  they have been revised. They have been revised down.

Fabrizio Campelli,0.01143430545926094,NEUTRAL
So we are very pleased with the progress we re making on the CRU. We have halved the RWA exposure since inception  we have reduced the leverage exposure by three quarters since inception  costs have been halved to   .  billion or so. And we actually see really good progress towards those targets we have laid out for     . And in fact  even improved  for example  on the cost side  numbers further  by virtue of us focusing quite systematically on the continued extraction of a number of charges.,0.4916299969772808,POSITIVE
Now the performance of the CRU is predicated on a lot of activities  from de-risking  to a successful execution of the sale of our Prime Finance business to BNP that transaction is fully on track. In fact  we re really quite pleased of how it s playing out. I think it s a positive transaction for us  for BNP and for our clients. It s actually playing out in the way we had envisaged. And we have continued to offer to our clients those services  obviously  now after the transaction has closed quite successfully.,0.48400808569567744,POSITIVE
As it relates to the outlook for the CRU  we do expect the targets for      of a reduction of RWAs down to approximately     billion to stay on track. We have been quite transparent on the composition of those     billion. The vast majority will be operational risk-weighted assets  which we ll pay down over time  approximately    million related to credit and market risk. And those are going to have a stickier profile. And so while we do not see a particularly adverse risk profile from those  we expect that it will take some time to unwind. Its things like structured repos with sovereigns  which obviously are safe positions that will nonetheless take a longer period of time to unwind. And so in that sense  we feel that the trajectory of the CRU  the liberation of capital strategy has worked well  will continue to serve us very well until       and we remain on track on all fronts.,0.013300974853336811,NEUTRAL

Fabrizio Campelli,0.01143430545926094,NEUTRAL
I can say a few words on that. We were quite pleased with how      played out. In fact  I remember  Magdalena  you asked me the question just last year when we were actually still physically on stage at Park Lane Hills at Hilton in Central London. And you asked me about how do we see loan losses  At the time  I think we had just started to give guidance of the    to    basis points for     . And we were pleased to actually land in a    basis points number for the year  which was within that guidance.,0.49144912671181373,POSITIVE
And I have to say this was down to a strong risk management framework that Deutsche Bank had embraced and strong discipline in the portfolio. We went into the crisis with and then continued to work with strong discipline to continue to de-risk as the year unfolded. If I look at       that strength has continued to show. So for example  for Q   we expect our credit loss provisions to come in at properly around half of the current consensus of      million. And we expect overall for       that the overall CLP profile to be materially lower than we had for     . And then we expect for      onwards to see a more normalized CLP environment of around    to    basis points.

Very  very encouraging to hear the numbers. All right. Superb. And then   and before we move to questions  Fabrizio  let s talk about something slightly different. You have been the best performing banking stock in SX P in     . And so how do you continue to build that kind of shareholder value into this year ,0.49304277906776406,POSITIVE
Fabrizio Campelli,0.01143430545926094,NEUTRAL
Yes. It was a very positive run for Deutsche Bank in     . We believe the best thing we can do is to continue to execute on the plan we have laid out. We are very focused on that    return on tangible equity in     . And we re doing this by everything we discussed today. On revenue  continuing growth to the level at which we are expecting it. That level  by the way  if you look at       would imply a  .   compounded annual growth rate for      and       which seems to be at reach given the momentum we re seeing  in fact  already in the first few weeks in the year.,0.4143729545176029,POSITIVE
And on cost  we spoke about it. There is a lot of discipline and a lot of focus on achieving those goals in a very systematic and very disciplined manner. And frankly  when we look at revenues being closed and had reached    consecutive quarters of cost reductions  which we intend to carry forward into the year  a robust credit position and framework that is making us comfortable around the plan  notwithstanding maintaining a lot of mitigants and maintaining overlays which we had in the second half of last year and carried into      to mitigate for risk.,0.3275622380897403,POSITIVE
We see that  that    return on tangible equity and the fact that we will be working our way to reach it quite consistently  and with the momentum we re seeing right now inside the bank  around the bank  is giving us confidence that the Deutsche Bank share price will continue to rise. At    return on tangible equity  we would be talking about a  . x tangible book or  call it      to     per share  if you assume that the price to   the tangible book per share value remains the same.,0.10812974022701383,NEUTRAL
And so obviously  we are very focused on not disappointing on our target. This is a management team that has really in the last    months delivered against everything it promises  and the intention will be to maintain that focus. If on top of that  you add the fact that we did speak about going back to capital returns from      onwards  and we have spoken about the    billion capital return strategy that would come on top. And of course  we would hope that all of this would be enough to continue to build that momentum on Deutsche Bank.,0.21030162181705236,NEUTRAL

And one more question on IB. And I   and it s a little bit kind of one sided. So kind of   so bear with me. You re the second bank this   at this conference which gave actually the kind of the year-to-date Investment Banking revenue growth number. So of course  you talked about     and Credit Suisse yesterday talked about    . So the question is  is that   do you feel of course  it s literally   it s a comparison one-on-one.

I think we gained across Investment Banking over   almost  .  percentage points of market share. And we see that momentum having continued actually in     .

So we   our strategy was to refocus our franchise. And therefore  when you think about how our Investment Bank has developed  it was in the context of the broader strategy in which we want our core bank and all of its   and partly  to be focused on areas in which we can compete to win. What we are seeing   and      was a good display of that  and      is actually very positive in confirming that  is that  that strategy of refocusing our franchise away from equities and much more into the origination advisory capital markets pieces and within FIC  on our financing  trading and the macro businesses  is actually paying out  because those are businesses in which DB has gained market share  has strengthened its position in ways that actually play right in the hand of the rest of the bank and in the rest of the franchise where we can truly become more client-centric and operate in businesses  in Investment Bank in which we can continue to support our  for example  corporate client base into      and beyond.,0.31527164159342647,POSITIVE

Fabrizio Campelli,0.01143430545926094,NEUTRAL
Well. We do have   we expect looking into our models that the vast majority of the adverse effect of the drag to revenues caused by the current curve environment will be digested by     . And so for us  the effort continues to be that of defending our NII through the strategies I outlined earlier  on deposit charging  on repricing  on systematic conversion of deposits into investments  focusing on inflows.,-0.0031759263947606087,NEUTRAL
All of these measures are going to contribute to maintaining as resilient and steady revenue outlook in our core bank  until we see more of that momentum kicking in later in       hopefully       and into       where we believe that  thanks to all this effort  combined  obviously  with the heavy lifting that is happening behind the scenes on costs  staying very disciplined on credit risk  it will help us to really turn those businesses into strong profitability momentum businesses into      and beyond.,0.13512861251365393,NEUTRAL
Magdalena Stoklosa,0.0003911633975803852,NEUTRAL
Perfect. And a couple of clarification kind of questions coming through. Fabrizio  you ve talked about the potential for a higher SRF fee  Can you just repeat that  You thought it could be      million  And that does not   and that does not impact your cost target. I mean that was the question. Whether the change in that charge impact your target at all ,0.4054953071754426,POSITIVE
Fabrizio Campelli,0.01143430545926094,NEUTRAL
Sure. I did mention that. So you remember that at the end of last year  James described our expectation on the SRF bank levy to be approximately      million for     . And that was predicated on the assumption of a fund being capped   the overall Single Resolution Fund being capped at approximately     billion. With the latest guidance of   from the Single Resolution Board  that the fund may be expanded to over     billion  we are obviously adjusting our obviously adjusting our charges accordingly  which we  therefore  believe  will be just under      million for     .,-0.1015516840852797,NEUTRAL
We obviously do not expect that this is already a decision for      as well  and we ll continue to advocate that  given that expansion of the base for the calculation of the levy is also driven by an expansion of deposits across European banks  driven by the very strong peculiarities of      and the pandemic  that  that should be resolved or should be addressed in future calculation  that will remain our focus.,-0.04439828544855118,MIXED
But either way  we remain committed to the    .  billion target. And of course  we will do everything to   even in      to counter the effects of that and   of that incremental charge relative to our original plan by basically targeting the same level of profitability we had before.,0.01072406955063343,NEUTRAL
Magdalena Stoklosa,0.0003911633975803852,NEUTRAL
Okay. Perfect. So thank you very much for that clarification. Now there s also a quick question  again  press topical  from the perspective of any impact from Greensill Insolvency.,0.49247646116418764,POSITIVE
Fabrizio Campelli,0.01143430545926094,NEUTRAL
Thank you. We do not have as a bank any direct exposure to Greensill or the GFG Alliance. We obviously are a German bank and are large contributor to the German deposit insurance schemes  and so there will likely be an impact from that perspective. But those schemes are fully funded  and so there is no expectation of any imminent impact deriving from those events. Of course  over time  there may be the need to replete   to refund those funds  certainly on the statutory  the voluntary side  there s to be decided. So it s still unclear and   when and how much this would result into. But we don t see this as being an imminent situation on DB.,0.01905778795480728,NEUTRAL

Of course        and it s expectations for kind of     . As you look at your kind of revenue diversification going forward  so kind of medium term  do you think that there is a situation where the other parts of the group are likely to increase their revenue mix  So a lot of moving parts  but kind of   but longer term  how do you see the revenue mix ,0.129589956253767,NEUTRAL
Fabrizio Campelli,0.01143430545926094,NEUTRAL
Well  our strategy has not changed to what we had announced in     . In fact  what is happening right now  it s clearly been more beneficial to the Investment Bank and the environment  particularly the adverse interest rates have really made it harder for the rest of our core bank businesses to perform to the level that is their potential. But based on everything we re doing and the things I was describing to you earlier  actually  there is a lot of untapped momentum  untapped potential in those businesses  which in a normalized interest rates environment  as we really think about that reflation wave that may come across will really benefit precisely those businesses that we see as the remaining part of our core strategy.,-0.039868731051683426,MIXED
So as you look into            and beyond  the strategy we laid out  to want to compete to win on four businesses  obviously  the Investment Bank  but also the Corporate Bank  a well-rounded Private Bank  which sits on our pillar in Germany and a pillar internationally  and our Asset Management franchise with BWS  we believe that all of them will actually behave quite strongly.,0.1281608985736966,NEUTRAL
The best thing we re doing right now is to ensure that  relative to competition  those businesses perform well. And already in       in a year in which everybody  in our continent in particular  suffered quite markedly from the macroeconomic environment around us  our franchises in Corporate Bank and in the Retail Bank actually performed quite strongly. So we expect all of that to then pay off all the effort and the confidence that we have  as a management team  our people  our clients  to help us navigate exactly the strategy we laid out. So that we can make Deutsche Bank sustainably profitable in the long term.,0.28201401326805353,POSITIVE

Great. Thanks  Steve and Jeff. Appreciate being here. We put out on our Investor Relations website a few charts. And we also put an  -K out with the charts on it  if anyone wants to take a look at those. But let me just summarize a couple of the few of the key points that are on there. Number one  we re reconfirming guidance for the first quarter and for the full year on net sales  operating EBITDA and adjusted EPS. So feeling very good about that.,0.4959435216005659,POSITIVE
Secondly  I would like to just highlight for a moment the Laird acquisition that we announced a week ago for   .  billion. Number one  strategically  we feel very good about the fit of this business with our E I segment. This business really brings   key technologies for us. They have a lot of solutions around managing heat and product -- protect devices from electromagnetic interference. And these are   very key items that need to be addressed over time with the miniaturization and more computing power that s occurring in the industry that  we think  is a great secular a growth area for us for many  many years to come.,0.35362144478131086,POSITIVE
And it really touches on a lot of capabilities across the board here  whether it s  G  smart autonomous vehicles  the Internet of Things  AI and high-performance computing  think of things like gaming consoles and things like that. So really a nice fit. And really  it will give us a solution sale to our OEM and customers in the marketplace  really a complete package. So we re really excited about that.,0.4941873720890726,POSITIVE
We re highly confident in the synergies we can get from this field. We ve announced cost synergies of     million. It s going to cost us     million to actually get those synergies  but we will have -- achieve a high single-digit ROIC on this by year  . So very confident in the financials of it. And we basically paid   x for the business with the cost synergies accounted in there. So again  we feel very good financially and I think a good investment for us  and therefore  for our shareholders.,0.4805834559665527,POSITIVE
And then let me just close with our capital allocation. As you all know  we had about    billion of excess cash going into this year and through this year. A lot of that came from the proceeds we got from the N B and IFF transaction. And so we will delever the balance sheet here. We got one more payment to make in May with an outstanding bond. And we will have our ratings -- or metrics right where we wanted   .    which is a very strong BBB rating. So balance sheet will be in great shape.,0.2487742118537426,POSITIVE
We announced last week  in addition to our already outstanding share repurchase  which is    billion  and then we just announced   .  billion on top of that  that will run for about the next year and a few months. So about   .  billion of share repurchase firepower here in the near term. And then  of course  with the   .  billion we paid for the Laird acquisition. You can see that about takes care of a lot of the cash very quickly that s excess sitting on our balance sheet.,0.08558178879320621,NEUTRAL
We are looking at -- as I ve highlighted on the last earnings call  we re looking at one other tuck-in acquisition. Don t know if it will happen or not.

If that is going to happen  it would be over the next quarter that we would know that and announce that.,-0.03389859199523926,NEUTRAL
Again  as we also announced on the last quarterly earnings. We re maintaining our current dividend of   .   per share  and we plan on talking to the Board in raising that consistently year in and year out. And we also  on our kind of allocation of capital  are keeping our CapEx at around   . We would like to work that down in a couple of years in the range of    to     but we have a couple of years here of a couple of big expansion products capped on in our electronics business and our new Line   on Tyvek. So that will be in that kind of low-  range for a couple of years  and then we ll work that down more as we move forward. And R D will continue to run at   . Remember  that s very varied by business  the highest spend  obviously  in the E I business  the lower spend in the M M business.

I think you see the numbers out there. Auto production might be down about   million units during this period of time here. But it s not a business that s going to be lost.

So there s a little bit of disruption with that.,-0.14183413423597813,NEUTRAL
But having said that  business is running very hot  and things might just shift out a little bit. I would think by the time we get through the second quarter  a lot of these issues will be resolved. So it s not a market share issue for anybody. It s just maybe delaying some -- but the actual auto business  finished goods inventory is low. Polymer inventory is low in the chain. So it s not like there s any buildup there. I mean the demand is there. And it can t totally be supplied in the time frame people want it.,-0.2167585175484419,MIXED
But I would just give you maybe another area. The residential business is running very hot  the do-it-yourself stuff on the resi side  really hot.

I would kind of put those in that -- by the way  they are recovering  coming up  but they re not back to kind of      levels.

Yes. Our forecast is that the PPE stuff for the frontline responders will start to decline  second  third and fourth quarter. But remember  we re sold out on Tyvek. So what we did last year to help with the pandemic is we shifted more of the production to the protective garments. And what we will now do -- we ve been shorting the housing market. We were shorting the medical packaging market. By the way  both are nice margin businesses. And so we ll -- if that occurs  where it starts to slow down  we ll start shifting over to those end markets. And the demand is there for us to do that.,-0.13399184867739677,NEUTRAL

Edward Breen,0.0004366460780147463,NEUTRAL
Yes. I would say a couple of areas. The pricing is more important in the M M business.

So we ll be down about    still because you re not lapping COVID there.,0.10612744837999344,MIXED
And then pricing is very constructive right now in that business. So we feel like any raw material increases  which  by the way  will be somewhat significant this year  we ll be able to cover that with price. And then you ll see more of the price as we go into the second quarter. Obviously  you ll see the ramp occur as we announced some price increases.,0.1512984298169613,POSITIVE

And so we ve had some real success with that this past year. So we re implementing a digital upgrade programs throughout the company. We ve got a phased by facility where we want to do things. And so that s our single biggest opportunity because  Jeff  as you know  in this business  a couple of points of uptime on some of these heavy assets is a big deal. So like think of the Tyvek line  the Kevlar line  the Nomex lines. It s a big  big deal for us. And a great example of that was the improvements we made in Tyvek last year and got the extra volumes out  and it just drops to the bottom line. So that s our single biggest area.,0.3476994507946074,POSITIVE
And then we ve really oriented our R D towards these higher secular growth areas  and I think that s going to pay off very well for us over the next   to   years. They happen to be the higher-growth areas like the Laird acquisition and where we re spending R D  for instance  in the E I business and those areas I mentioned a few minutes ago. And they happen to be businesses there for that are going to command higher gross margins  and therefore  higher EBITDA margin.,0.0440511517226696,NEUTRAL
So we think we ve got a     to     basis point opportunity in the businesses over multiple years. And so a big focus there. And obviously  pricing plays into gross margin expansion. And as we launch these new products in these growth areas  we ll make sure we get the right price for them.

Yes. Look  I feel good about where we ve gotten to so far. I ve always said it s kind of -- I look at it as a  -pronged approach. One was to resolve the rest of the MDL in Ohio. We did that across DuPont      million. I think the biggest thing  though  on that same announcement was we finally got a deal done. I think we were working on it for about a year  me personally  by the way. And we have a deal now worked out between Corteva  Chemours and us.

So now that we can all work together  I think there s a path to resolve the firefighting foam  which is the bulk of all the cases left  whether it s states  it s individual claims. The good news is that s mostly consolidated into an MDL down in South Carolina. And so you can actually wrap your arms around either letting it play out through the court system  which will prove out DuPont has extremely low exposure here when the facts keep coming out  or do we take the path of potentially the   companies working together to come up with a settlement agreement.,-0.020385317504405975,NEUTRAL

But for the heritage DuPont portfolio  it is going from about      a car today for an ICE engine up to north of      for a fully electric vehicle.

At the same time  we remain focused on advancing our operating priorities and strategic initiatives  as we continue to meet the evolving needs of our customers and further position Dollar General for long-term sustainable growth.,0.04677193479437847,NEUTRAL
To that end  we re excited to share an update on some of our plans for     . First  we plan to further the rollout of several value-creating initiatives  including our non-consumables initiative  Fast Track and the completion of our initial rollout of DG Fresh.,0.28376143745845184,POSITIVE
In addition  while still early  we are very pleased with the results of our pOpshelf stores  which have far exceeded our initial expectations for both sales and gross margin. As a result  we plan to accelerate our pace of new store openings for pOpshelf in      and expect to incorporate this concept into a number of our larger-format Dollar General locations  as we look to capitalize on the significant growth opportunity we see for this differentiated concept.,0.4067147539681173,POSITIVE
We are also pleased to highlight key changes to our development strategy  including plans to build on the success of our Dollar General Plus store  or DGP  and the introduction of two new store formats  which we began testing in     .,0.47308872684516245,POSITIVE
Similar to our larger-footprint DGP concept  the first new format has a selling space of approximately       square feet  which compares to about       square feet of selling space for our traditional store.,0.047478826832957566,NEUTRAL

Our second new format is even larger with approximately       square selling feet and will be deployed opportunistically across new store  relocation and remodel opportunities. Notably  on average our DGP and new store formats are outperforming the chain on a comp sales basis and have considerably higher sales volumes compared to both the traditional and DGTP store  which bodes well for the future as we look to increase their unit counts in the years ahead.,0.13032922381535172,NEUTRAL
Finally  we are pleased to provide an update on a number of our new small box store opportunities we see available in the continental United States  which represents an increase compared to our prior estimate.,0.43710859524435364,POSITIVE
Jeff will discuss these updates in more detail later in the call. But first let s recap some of the highlights for the fourth quarter and full year. The quarter was once again highlighted by strong growth on both the top and bottom lines.,0.1899818600504659,NEUTRAL
We re pleased that for the quarter our three non-consumable categories once again delivered a combined comp sales increase well in excess of our consumable business. Of note  this represents our   th consecutive quarter of year-over-year comp sales growth in our combined non-consumable categories  which we believe speaks to the strong and sustained momentum in these product categories.,0.4907182059250772,POSITIVE
From a multi-cadence perspective  comp sales in December increased in the high single-digit range with similar mid-teens growth in both November and January. In total fourth quarter net sales increased   .   to   .  billion  primarily driven by comp sales growth of   .  . These results include significant growth in average basket size and units in particular partially offset by a decline in customer traffic. And while customers continue to consolidate trips on average they are spending more with us compared to last year.,0.007502494379878044,NEUTRAL
Once again this quarter  we increased our market share in highly consumable product sales as measured by syndicated data driven by a meaningful increase in both units and dollars. Importantly  our data suggests an increase in new customers this quarter as compared to Q  of     . These new customers continue to skew younger  higher income and more ethnically diverse underscoring the broadened appeal of our value and convenience proposition.,0.11054940498434007,NEUTRAL
We continue to be encouraged by the retention rates of new customers and we are working to drive even higher levels of engagement with more personalized marketing and continued execution of our key initiatives.,0.13790032584802248,NEUTRAL
We re particularly pleased that we delivered significant operating margin expansion  which contributed to fourth quarter diluted EPS of   .   an increase of   .   over the prior year.,0.47759788198163733,POSITIVE
For the full year  net sales increased   .   to    .  billion including net sales growth of   .   in our combined non-consumable categories. Comp sales for the year increased   .   representing our   st consecutive year of same-store sales growth. In       we celebrated the opening of our       th store and the launch of our newest store concept pOpshelf.,0.12248841940890998,NEUTRAL
In total  we completed a record       real estate projects during the year exceeding our initial target of       projects as we continue to build and strengthen the foundation for future growth.,0.1550612327773706,NEUTRAL
From a position of strength  we also made targeted investments in other key areas including the acceleration of certain strategic initiatives to strengthen our competitive position and further differentiate and distance Dollar General from the rest of the discount retail landscape.,0.028215614627697505,NEUTRAL
Collectively  our fourth quarter and full year results reflect strong and disciplined execution across many fronts and further validate our belief that we are pursuing the right strategies to enable sustainable growth while creating meaningful long-term shareholder value.,0.15266685133974534,NEUTRAL

John Garratt,0.0008716667507542297,NEUTRAL
Thank you  Todd and good morning everyone. Now that Todd has taken you through a few highlights of the quarter and full year  let me take you through some of its important financial details. Unless  we specifically note otherwise  all comparisons are year-over-year. All references to EPS refer to diluted earnings per share  and all years noted refer to the corresponding fiscal year.,0.3299449351616204,POSITIVE
As Todd already discussed sales  I will start with gross profit which was positively impacted in the quarter by a significant increase in sales  including the impact of COVID-  . Gross profit as a percentage of sales was   .   in the fourth quarter  an increase of    basis points which represents our seventh consecutive quarter of year-over-year gross margin rate expansion. This increase was primarily attributable to  a reduction in markdowns as a percentage of sales  higher initial markups on inventory purchases  a greater proportion of sales coming from non-consumable categories  and a reduction in shrink as a percentage of sales. These factors were partially offset by  increased transportation and distribution costs  which were impacted by increased volume  some of which is attributable to the COVID-   pandemic  as well as higher transportation rates and discretionary employee bonus expense for our distribution center and private fleet employees.,0.0064722690731287,NEUTRAL
SG A as a percentage of sales was   .    an increase of    basis points. This increase was primarily driven by incremental costs related to COVID-    including appreciation bonuses paid to our frontline retail employees  and health and safety-related expenses as well as increased incentive compensation expense and hurricane-related expenses. These items were partially offset by certain expenses  which were lower as a percentage of sales  including occupancy costs  retail  labor and depreciation and amortization.,-0.005420104833319783,NEUTRAL
Moving down the income statement. Operating profit for the fourth quarter increased     to      million. As a percent of sales operating profit was   .    an increase of    basis points. Operating profit in the fourth quarter was positively impacted by COVID-    primarily through higher sales. The benefit from higher sales was partially offset by approximately     million  or     basis points of incremental investments that we made in response to the pandemic  including approximately     million in appreciation bonuses for eligible frontline employees  and additional measures taken to further protect our employees and customers.,0.012992346659302711,NEUTRAL
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was   .   and compares to     in the fourth quarter last year. Finally  as Todd noted earlier  EPS for the fourth quarter increased   .   to   .    which contributed to full year EPS of    .    an increase of   .  .,0.018307726830244064,NEUTRAL
Turning now to our balance sheet and cash flow  which remain strong and provide us the financial flexibility to further support our customers and employees during these unprecedented times  while continuing to invest for the long term and provide meaningful returns to shareholders. Merchandise inventories were   .  billion at the end of the year  an increase of   .   overall and  .   on a per-store basis.,0.12811173481168225,NEUTRAL
While a lot of stocks remain higher than we would like for certain high-demand products  we continue to make good progress with improving our in-stock position and are pleased with our overall inventory levels.,0.35002500761765987,POSITIVE
In       we generated significant cash flow from operations totaling   .  billion  an increase of   .  billion  or   .  . Total capital expenditures for the year were    billion and included our planned investments in new stores remodels and relocations  distribution and transportation projects  and spending related to our strategic initiatives.,0.0052473279283731245,NEUTRAL
During the quarter  we repurchased  .  million shares of our common stock for      million  and paid a quarterly dividend of   .   per common share outstanding at a total cost of     million. With today s announcement of an incremental share repurchase authorization we have remaining authorization of approximately   .  billion under the repurchase program.,0.007179058622568846,NEUTRAL
Our capital allocation priorities continue to serve us well and remain unchanged. Our first priority is investing in high-return growth opportunities  including new store expansion and our strategic initiatives. We also remain committed to returning significant cash to shareholders through anticipated share repurchases and quarterly dividend payments  all while maintaining our current investment-grade credit rating and managing to a leverage ratio of approximately three times adjusted debt to EBITDA.,0.034910088186734356,NEUTRAL
Moving to our financial outlook for     . We continue to operate in a time of uncertainty regarding the severity and duration of the COVID-   pandemic  including its impact on the economy  consumer behavior and our business. Despite continued uncertainty  we are providing select annual guidance in an effort to provide the best view we reasonably can based on what we currently know.,0.024737784871831536,NEUTRAL
That said  there could be a number of potential headwinds and tailwinds this year  which are not incorporated into our guidance as the timing degree and potential impacts on our business are currently unclear  including but not limited to  the recently approved government stimulus package  other unknown external factors related to the ongoing health crisis  including its impact on consumer behavior and additional changes to minimum wage rates.,-0.06293881544843316,NEUTRAL
With this in mind  we currently expect the following for     . Net sales in the range of a    decline to flat  a same-store sales decline of    to     but which reflects growth of approximately     to     on a two-year stack basis  and EPS in the range of   .   to   .    which reflects a compound annual growth rate between     and      or between     and     on an adjusted basis over a two-year period which is well above our long-term goal of delivering at least     annual EPS growth on an adjusted basis. Our EPS guidance assumes an effective tax rate in the range of     to    .,0.0074987628031522036,NEUTRAL
Capital spending is expected to be in the range of   .   billion to   .   billion as we continue to invest in our strategic initiatives and core business  to support and drive future growth. With regards to shareholder returns  as outlined in today s press release  our Board of Directors recently approved a quarterly dividend payment of   .   per share  which represents an increase of   .  . We also plan to repurchase a total of approximately   .  billion of our common stock this year  reflecting our strong liquidity position and confidence about the long-term growth opportunity for our business. Finally  as noted in today s press release  our outlook for       real estate projects remains unchanged from what we stated in our Q  earnings release on December        .,0.02818421927804593,NEUTRAL
Let me now provide some additional context  as it relates to our expectations. Given the unusual situation  I will elaborate on our comp sales trends thus far in Q . Despite approximately       lost store operating days as a result of closures due to winter weather across the country  same-store sales for the month of February  increased  .    reflecting a healthy comp sales increase of   .   on a two-year stack basis. From the end of February through March     comp sales decreased approximately      as we are in the midst of lapping our most difficult monthly comp sales comparison of the year. As a reminder  comp sales growth for the month of March in      was   .  .,-0.04019307950511575,NEUTRAL
Looking ahead  we remain cautious in our      sales outlook  given the continued significant uncertainty that still exists  as well as the unique comparisons against last year. That said  as you think about the sales cadence of       our performance is expected to be stronger in the second half  given a more difficult sales comparison in the first half and particularly in Q .,-0.015299277380108833,NEUTRAL
Turning to gross margin. In       gross margins benefited from a greater proportion of sales coming from our higher-margin non-consumable categories  driven by a full year net sales percentage increase of these categories  well in excess of our consumables business. We expect our sales mix will ultimately shift towards our consumables categories in       resulting in pressure on our rate. However  the timing of when this dynamic may occur and its corresponding impact to gross margin are currently uncertain.,-0.004143084399402142,NEUTRAL
Gross margins in      also benefited from a reduction in markdowns  including the benefit of higher sell-through rates as a result of significant customer demand in seasonal and other clearance-sensitive non-consumable categories. In       we expect our markdown rates will increase somewhat from the abnormally low levels we saw in       which likely will create some gross margin pressure compared to last year.,0.03538273461163044,NEUTRAL
In addition  while we continue to see the effect of higher carrier rates and fuel costs  our ongoing efforts to improve efficiencies and reduce expenses  including further expansion of our private fleet are expected to help partially mitigate these cost pressures in     . Also  please keep in mind  that the second and third quarters  represent the most challenging laps of the year from a gross profit rate perspective  following improvements of     basis points in Q        and     basis points in Q       .,0.008056770311668515,NEUTRAL
In terms of SG A  while we expect to incur ongoing expenses related to the pandemic in       overall we anticipate a meaningful reduction in COVID-  -related costs compared to last year. However  the leverage from these reduced costs is expected to be offset by deleverage associated with lower comp sales and approximately     million to     million in incremental year-over-year investments related to our strategic initiatives  as we further the rollouts.,-0.0030163892079144716,NEUTRAL
With regard to our strategic initiatives  in aggregate  we anticipate they will positively contribute to operating profit and margin in       driven by NCI and DG Fresh  as we expect the benefits to gross margin from our initiatives will more than offset the associate expense. Finally  we estimate operating profit will be negatively impacted by approximately     million to     million in Q  as a result of lost sales from storage closures and expenses related to the widespread winter weather that we experienced in February.,-0.012291617691516876,NEUTRAL
In closing  we are very proud of the team s execution and performance  which resulted in exceptional fourth quarter and full year results. As always  we continue to be disciplined in how we manage expenses and capital  with the goal of delivering  consistent  strong financial performance  while strategically investing for the long term. We remain confident in our business model and our ongoing financial priorities to drive  profitable same-store sales growth  healthy new store returns  strong free cash flow and long-term shareholder value.,0.34226771593966987,POSITIVE
With that  I will turn the call over to Jeff.,0.03008989803493023,NEUTRAL
Jeff Owen,0.00024249262060038745,NEUTRAL
Thank you  John. Let me take the next few minutes to update you on our operating priorities  including our strategic initiatives and plans for     . Our first operating priority is driving profitable sales growth. The team did a fantastic job in       executing against our portfolio of growth initiatives. Let me highlight some of our more recent efforts  as we look to further build on our progress in     .,0.3805059262958821,POSITIVE
Starting with our non-consumables initiative or NCI. As a reminder  NCI consists of a new and expanded product offering in key non-consumable categories. The NCI offering was available in more than       stores at the end of       including nearly     stores in our light version. This compares to our prior expectation of more than       stores at year-end.,0.04166257835458964,NEUTRAL
Given our strong performance to date  we plan to expand this offering to about       additional stores this year  bringing the total number of NCI stores to more than        by year-end. This total includes over       stores in our light version  which incorporates a vast majority of the NCI assortment  but through a more streamlined approach.,0.17965266879764386,NEUTRAL
Moving to our newest concept pOpshelf  which further builds on our success in learnings with NCI. pOpshelf aims to engage customers by offering a fun  affordable and differentiated treasure hunt experience  delivered through continually refreshed merchandise  a differentiated in-store experience and exceptional value with about     of our items priced at    or less.,0.251267373241717,POSITIVE
We opened our first five locations in     . And as Todd mentioned  given our strong results to-date  we plan to accelerate the rollout of pOpshelf in     . In fact  we are now targeting to have a total of up to    pOpshelf stores opened by year end compared to our previous goal of about    total locations. In addition to these stores  we also plan to incorporate this concept in up to    Dollar General stores in     .,0.07979746209457517,NEUTRAL
In terms of our store-within-a-store concept  a smaller footprint pOpshelf shop will be prominently positioned in the center of the store and we will display both Dollar General and pOpshelf branding on exterior entrances to build and maximize awareness.,0.017481422604760155,NEUTRAL
From these initial stores  our goal is to test  learn and ultimately expand to more locations over time as we look to leverage the unique strengths of these complementary formats and build on our early success with pOpshelf by making it more available to a broader range of customers.,0.05068040247715544,NEUTRAL
Turning now to DG Fresh  which is a strategic multiphase shift to self-distribution of frozen and refrigerated goods. The primary objective of DG Fresh is to reduce product costs on our frozen and refrigerated items and we continue to be very pleased with the product cost savings we are seeing.,0.3084560975548811,POSITIVE
In fact  DG Fresh continues to be the largest contributor to the gross margin benefit we are realizing from higher initial markups on inventory purchases and we expect this benefit to grow as we continue to scale this transformational initiative.,0.15223889180924743,NEUTRAL
Another important goal of DG Fresh is to increase sales in these categories. We are pleased with the success we are seeing on this front driven by higher overall in-stock levels and the introduction of new products in select stores being serviced by DG Fresh.,0.3098176012863405,POSITIVE
Given our success to-date  we are further accelerating the rollout of additional offerings with the recent introduction of even more products including both national and private brands as we look to further optimize our assortment  while increasing our relevance with customers. And while produce is not included in our initial rollout plans  we believe DG fresh provides a potential path forward to expanding our produce offering to more than        stores over time as we look to further capitalize on our extensive self-distribution capabilities.,0.08433411829173565,NEUTRAL
In total  we were self-distributing to more than        stores from    facilities at the end of     . This compares to our previous expectation of over        stores at year end. Overall  we remain well on track to complete our initial rollout across the chain in     .,0.2648242504801601,POSITIVE

Michael Lasser,-0.0015587651287205517,NEUTRAL
Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. So it looks like you re guiding to about    basis points of operating margin expansion between      and     . Why wouldn t it be more than that  Given you re comping better than your algorithm would suggest on a two-year stack basis plus you re benefiting from all these margin-enhancing initiatives like DG Fresh  Fast Track  NCI and others. And how -- within that  how would you expect your gross margin to shake out this year versus      ,0.19576045125722885,POSITIVE
John Garratt,0.0008716667507542297,NEUTRAL
Yes. So I ll tackle both those questions  Michael. This is John. First of all  I d say  we re really pleased with what we did in       expanding our operating margin     basis points. We didn t give specific guidance on operating margin or the components. But we did call out that some of the headwinds  the biggest headwind being the SG A deleverage that goes along with lower comp sales this year.,0.0843934454023838,MIXED
We also talked about anticipating a mix shift back toward consumables  which does have a margin impact to both the sales mix as well as markdowns as we would be lapping unusually low clearance markdowns last year. And then we also mentioned higher carrier rates and fuel costs. So these are all costs that pressure operating margin overall.,-0.19423743709921837,NEUTRAL
Now you also asked about gross margin. As you think about gross margin  again  we feel great about what we did this year  delivering    basis points of gross margin expansion. This is our seventh consecutive quarter doing that     basis points for the year. And to your point initiatives like DG Fresh and NCI are really contributing and impactful to the biggest drivers that we called out.,0.32318679662421346,POSITIVE
The three biggest drivers we called out were lower markdowns  higher initial markups and the mix benefit in NCI and DG Fresh were significant contributors to those. But we also as I mentioned are seeing in the near term higher distribution and transportation costs. So  as we look ahead in the near term  these will weigh in the near term. But as you look at the longer-term  we do feel like we re well positioned to continue expanding -- resume expanding gross margin and operating margin over the longer term for the reasons you mentioned  the scaling of these initiatives that are the gifts that keep on giving and all the levers we ve talked about before within gross margin and within SG A.,0.044158875942230225,NEUTRAL
But at the same time  it s noted that we continue to invest in the business. And so to make sure we sustain our ambition of being     double-digit EPS growers over the long-term  we are continuing as we called out to reinvest in the business. We mentioned     million to     million that s hitting SG A next year. And then the other thing I ll mention is in terms of COVID expenses  we will continue to have some COVID expenses associated with protecting and ensuring the health and safety of our employees and customers. How much that is going to be varies on what the situation dictates. But we ve captured all our best estimates in the guidance for these drivers.,0.03222004696726799,NEUTRAL
Michael Lasser,-0.0015587651287205517,NEUTRAL
Understood. That s very helpful. And my second question is very myopic. And we re all just trying to figure out what s going to happen as we get through the next several months. And if we just take the math of down     versus the   .   in March of last year  it would imply a high teens two-year stack. So can you give us some flavor for how March unfolded last year  Have you -- are you just now entering the toughest compares within the month such that a high teens two-year stack would be  kind of  a false positive indication on what to expect over the next few months ,-0.10881134867668152,NEGATIVE
John Garratt,0.0008716667507542297,NEUTRAL
Yeah. I can help you there Michael. I ll start by saying  it s bumpy  right  There s a lot of noise. You had the storm in February. And then in March  you re extrapolating over a very short period of time  which was pretty bumpy last year. But to help you out here  we called out  yes  as you mentioned the negative     month-to-date from the end of February through March   th this year. If you look at the corresponding period of time last year  it was not dissimilar to the   .   comp where we ended the period  so fairly representative. But again there s a fair bit of noise within this  so I d be cautious in extrapolating too much based on that. But hopefully that helps you understand where we were at this point.,-0.05990852415561676,NEUTRAL

Simeon Gutman,0.0024021379358600825,NEUTRAL
Thanks. Good morning  everyone. A couple of questions  I guess  first on the comps. The     to     that you mentioned in the release on a two-year stack  it actually felt like that s a doable number going forward if you take all the initiatives. And so -- yet you re still going to have stimulus at least in the first part of the year probably now and for a little while longer. And so  I guess  the top line feels a little conservative in that regard. Just can you talk about that  Any thoughts around it  why -- if the     to     in our view is doable  why couldn t the top-line end up being a little bit stronger ,0.13822074979543686,MIXED
John Garratt,0.0008716667507542297,NEUTRAL
Sure. Let me unpack that for you. And again just dialing the clock back a little bit  we ve said historically that this model works really well at a    to    comp. That s the engine of the    -plus EPS growth algorithm. So with a two-year comp stack of     to     over two years that represents a pretty meaningful step-change improvement over that.,0.1808744315057993,MIXED
And I tell you we feel great about the fundamentals of the business. As you said  the relevance of the brand  the broadening appeal  the new customers we ve brought in  the bigger baskets we re enjoying I d say the business model has never been stronger. And as noted  the initiatives are really clicking and contributing to this relevance.,0.45700673351529986,POSITIVE
So we feel good about the guidance that we ve provided. But we did note that -- and it s based on what we know  but what we did note was that we didn t include the impact of stimulus. because it s really relatively unknown what impact it will have to what degree it might help. So that s not taken into consideration in the guidance. It could be an upside. I hope it is. But there s just a lot of uncertainty when you think about  one  compared to the previous stimulus rounds  which helped us  the economy is opening up now more. And so we are competing with other segments of the economy outside of retail for that share of wallet. So how much we get is uncertain.,-0.012340061366558075,MIXED
And then the other piece is surveys of consumers have said that they plan to save more this time. They plan to spend more paying off bills. Now a lot of times what people say and do is two different things and so it remains to be seen if that s the case. So we re cautiously optimistic. We didn t build it in. It could be an upside  but it s just very difficult to say if it will be upside and to what degree.,-0.20679880678653717,NEGATIVE
Simeon Gutman,0.0024021379358600825,NEUTRAL
Okay. That s helpful. And then my follow-up and maybe take another shot at something Michael just asked. If you look at the gross margins versus      and John you mentioned some transportation costs  is there any reason why they shouldn t be higher than      ,-0.04519902169704437,NEUTRAL
John Garratt,0.0008716667507542297,NEUTRAL
Yeah. Again I don t want to get into the specifics of guidance around operating margin for this year. We wanted to give -- there s a high degree of uncertainty  we wanted to give some guidance that we gave the top line and the bottom line.,-0.08115680702030659,NEUTRAL
I ll just say that we re really pleased with the performance we ve been delivering over the last few years  growing our gross margin and the operating margin again over two points this year. But again there s a lot of unknown this year  a lot of potential pressures. With that comp that we mentioned  when you look at this year that does create some deleverage. And again  we are investing in the business. Now again that investment piece is accretive  but then you do have other pressures such as carrier rates and then obviously  you do have other inflationary pressures.,0.049533489160239697,MIXED

And then on the double-digit two-year stack that you forecasted for this year  how much of the acceleration relative to the past two years do you believe is driven by new customer acquisition or market share gains  Trying to get a sense for that two-year stack of double-digits relative to mid-to-high single digits the trailing two years. How much of this acceleration do you believe is sustainable ,-0.0265648290514946,NEUTRAL
Todd Vasos,-0.010634209029376507,NEUTRAL
Yes. This is Todd. Yes  I would tell you let me take the second part first. I would tell you that that comp we believe that we are retaining a nice portion of the new customers that we saw come in. We can see that with our data at a pretty good real-time rate. And the great thing is we ve seen them continue to come back so repeat as well. So we feel good about that going into     . We see them still here in       which is really good to see.,0.4440805302001536,POSITIVE
And again with all of our initiatives  Matt  that we ve got put together I would tell you that it gives her a lot of confidence to continue to shop with us. So I know I m not going to give you exactly what you re looking for  but I would tell you that it plays a portion of it. But I would also say that all of our initiatives also really come into play here.,0.26797168981283903,POSITIVE
And then what we ve seen so far just to give you a little bit more color non-consumables or that discretionary side of the business continues to do very well for us into the early part of Q  here. And as we move through March  it will become even more meaningful because as you recall the stock-up trip from last year with the pandemic with paper and cleaning and many of the consumable food  perishable areas really took off last year and non-consumables were a little soft quite frankly. And we re seeing the opposite quite frankly right now. So that s great to see.,0.058722225949168205,MIXED
But what we can also see is that our initiatives around non-consumables has really helped because our baskets seem to be a little higher with those non-consumables in them as well. So they re spending at a good rate there and we believe that she ll continue to do that as we move into the middle part of the year.,0.33537454437464476,POSITIVE
Matthew Boss,0.002526708325603977,NEUTRAL
Great. And then maybe just to follow up John on the SG A front. Could you just help quantify what you ve embedded in the guidance from a COVID expense perspective just so we can baseline it  And then ex the strategic investments  is there any change to  .   to     I think that s roughly been the underlying comp leverage point in the model. Any change to that ,0.23998482339084148,POSITIVE
John Garratt,0.0008716667507542297,NEUTRAL
Yes. I ll tackle both of those. First in terms of the COVID spend  obviously  we re going to do what s necessary to ensure the health and safety of our employees and customers. The guidance captures the best guess of the spending needs associated with that. That s of course going to vary based on the severity and duration of the pandemic. But safe to say we ve built in a considerable reduction of that assuming an improvement of the situation there. And that s what s captured in the guidance. We didn t give a specific number on that  but it is a considerable step down.,0.12536012567579746,MIXED
As you think about SG A and the  .   to    leverage point  we ve kind of dissuaded people from sticking to that because there is that geography that you noted. One we are investing in SG A to drive overall operating margin expansion particularly gross margin. And so as you look at things like DG Fresh as we re taking over self-distribution  NCI you spend a little bit on SG A to save a lot more and drive a lot more benefit on gross margin  so it s very beneficial overall. But it does throw off the math on that.,-0.03892462141811848,MIXED
And then there are some other initiatives like pOpshelf and others that are more --have more of a start-up cost nature. So it pressures that. And then the other thing we ve done is we ve really stepped up the remodels and so that puts a little bit of pressure on the front end of that. So if you strip all those out that s a lot to strip out that as well as the COVID expenses  yes we re still looking at that  .   to    leverage point. Nothing has structurally changed. And our -- certainly our focus on cost containment is sharper than ever. But that s really the only change to that.,-0.026674926280975342,MIXED
But for the next few years as we scale those and we operationalize DG Fresh you have to put a little bit of labor in the stores for instance and a little bit of contract labor to remodel the stores. That s really the big driver there. But overall it s accretive from a dollar perspective and a rate perspective.,0.007606808096170425,MIXED

Scot Ciccarelli,0.0001919519854709506,NEUTRAL
Good morning  guys. So I apologize upfront about another sales-related question. But we do know that the stack comps start to get distorted when we deal with bigger numbers and bigger swings. So  if we were to basically dollarize your comps for lack of a better term  it looks like there really wasn t much of a change in your sales run rate like from a sales per store perspective between March -- February and March.,-0.361444940790534,NEGATIVE
So  two questions  first is that a fair assumption  And then related to that assuming you maintain a pretty steady -- are you assuming that you re going to maintain a pretty steady sales per store cadence for the balance of the year  or are you expecting a deceleration in kind of sales per store during the course of the year as we hopefully enter a more normalized environment ,-0.10825378261506557,NEUTRAL
John Garratt,0.0008716667507542297,NEUTRAL
Yes  that s a good question. I ll start with the second question. As you look at the guidance we provided this year  we do -- a key element of that is assuming that we retain a considerable portion of the new customers that came in and the bigger baskets that came in. A big piece of that is the initiatives we ve put in place like NCI that position us so well to get a piece of that share of wallet as people came into the brand and like what they saw as well as the coolers that provided a fuller fill in trip when people are looking for groceries.,0.2765467222779989,POSITIVE
So  we ve assumed a pretty considerable retention of that. But as we ve looked at it throughout the year  we ve also said that the share of wallet probably will shift a little bit. Right now there is concurrent with the pandemic there is a consolidation of trips and we re benefiting from that as well as again benefiting from that share of wallet.,0.029004991054534912,MIXED
So  as you go through the year  we assume you do lose a little bit of that tailwind as you re competing with other segments of the economy for that share of wallet. But still very positive on how much we can retain and again the fundamentals of the business and the relevance of the brand as people have come in.,0.1938534644432366,NEUTRAL
And again as we said I don t want to dissect February and March too much because again it was pretty bumpy with the storms in February and a lot of puts and takes in March and again  you re extrapolating over a pretty short period of time. So  when you strip out all the noise  I would tell you that again with the guidance we provided that contemplates what we ve seen up to this point. And I think the wildcard is again stimulus and we just didn t put anything in for that because we just don t know what that benefit will be and to what degree.,-0.008409231901168823,MIXED

Karen Short,3.1474046409130096e-06,NEUTRAL
Hi thanks very much. I just wanted to get a little bit of color in terms of how we should think about kind of the composition of traffic versus ticket as we go into calendar       I mean obviously you saw a pretty meaningful I think deceleration in traffic in February but that s off of a pretty high number in February of the prior year. So  wondering if you could talk a little bit about that just broadly.,0.2870975732803345,POSITIVE
And then I wanted to talk a little bit more about     as it relates to gross margins. So  the question I have on that is how should we think about the base level of gross margin for       Because it seems like you are at a much more permanently elevated base on the gross margin front. And I know      is just so hard to talk through because there are so many moving parts  but I wanted to kind of pivot the conversation to      on the gross margin front.,-0.1119648041203618,NEUTRAL
Todd Vasos,-0.010634209029376507,NEUTRAL
Thanks for the question Karen. I ll take the first part and then kick it over to John for the      gross margin discussion. So  on the traffic side  again  February was pretty choppy. You had the storms that quite frankly we -- you saw in the release       store hours of lost time  but the bigger thing is we -- for a day to almost two days  we had anywhere from     to     of our store base close for that time. So  it s a little choppy to be able to talk about traffic in February and then what s happened in March. But I think the way to look at it is we feel really good about that traffic number overall where we see it. It was very similar to where it had been coming out of Q .,0.3424421660602093,POSITIVE
As John said  as you start to pull away some of these puts and takes  I think it s important. We saw a little bit of an uptick in traffic when that stimulus came out the second round of stimulus. And with only a couple of days to measure we ve seen an uptick in traffic and overall sales with this recent stimulus. But again  I caution it s still very early to tell what s going to happen here.,0.010040994733572006,MIXED
But I think the bigger picture is we re retaining a lot of those customers as I mentioned earlier that we got during the pandemic. And we re still working very hard to keep Dollar General top of mind to those customers so that when she continues to consider where to shop for her everyday needs and many of these new non-consumable type items that we ve got in our stores  she still comes to us.,0.2937537841498852,POSITIVE
So  we believe we re seeing that repeat customer. And there s no reason why -- we deserve and have the right to keep that customer based on our service of her in the past as well as what we believe we can do in the future for her. John ,0.3007796462625265,POSITIVE
John Garratt,0.0008716667507542297,NEUTRAL
Yeah. And then to the second part of the question  and I agree with you  there s just a lot of noise in     . I think one thing  I would point to as you look at over that two year period lots of puts and takes. But when you get to the bottom line a two year CAGR of     to     I think really speaks to the step-change performance in the top line  and the flow-through. It makes you feel good about the future.,0.05540010426193476,MIXED
Now  I don t want to give specific guidance around     . It s premature for that. But as you unpack the drivers of gross margin in Q   and for the full year  as I mentioned  it s the strategic initiatives  which are the core drivers of that. And those still have a lot of tentacles and legs to those that help us going forward. And we re reloading with other initiatives to help drive gross margin.,-0.13587732054293156,MIXED
Now the one thing that we mentioned just        a little bit was the mix  so that s why we cautioned that we expect the mix to normalize or move back toward consumables somewhat  which is a bit of a drag. But the thing   the other items driving that gross margin expansion we expect to continue. And so that s why I mentioned that as we get through the noise of this year  and would encourage people to look at that two year stack and push forward the same drivers are there that makes you feel good about our ability to continue to grow gross margin over the long term  not only the scaling of the existing initiatives in new ones  but really pleased what we ve seen with the shrink improvement  the supply chain efficiencies  a lot of opportunities still around private brands  penetration expansion for in-sourcing expansion. The team continues to do a great job with category management.,-0.0031755194067955017,MIXED
Again  when you look at our scale and our growing scale  as a limited SKU shop it really puts us in a very favorable position  to get best pricing there and protect our margins while also being well priced. And on the price front  we ll always reserve the right to invest as needed. But as we look at now  and as we ve seen for quite a while now  we feel like we re in the best position on pricing we ve been in  and don t see at least the foreseeable future the need to invest there. So we feel good about the long-term ability to continue to grow gross margin  while also driving traffic and sales.,0.32531994860619307,POSITIVE
Todd Vasos,-0.010634209029376507,NEUTRAL
Yeah. Karen  I would also just   just say real quick  and then get to the next question is that  I feel as good about this business than I have the    almost    years that I ve been here. And the long-term outlook of this business is stronger than ever. And as John indicated  I think once we get through the noise of       I believe that algorithm is very much intact. And as you have seen even prior to COVID  we were running at the top end of that algorithm and many of the components of it. And there s no reason why that shouldn t continue as we can   as we go long term.,0.29177437350153923,POSITIVE

John Garratt,0.0008716667507542297,NEUTRAL
Well  I think the way to   yeah  I think the way to look at this is I think we did quantify the impact of the storm on operating profit  and a meaningful piece of that was the sales impact. So if you look at  the overall dollars  we quantified about half of that was sales flow through. So maybe that s the way to dimensionalize that.,0.06838437914848328,NEUTRAL

Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So I guess  John first starting with guidance. I was curious  what your team is assuming for the promotional backdrop. And as your trends have turned negative and a number of other players are also starting to turn negative  I was just curious  if you have seen any shifts in the promotional backdrop lately ,0.07879593223333359,NEUTRAL
John Garratt,0.0008716667507542297,NEUTRAL
Yeah. As you look at the promotional backdrop  we think it remains rational. It s been that way for the last about a year and half  so things have been pretty consistent. And so as we look forward  we re not assuming any major changes there because we feel like we re very well positioned on price. And Todd  do you want to add anything ,0.11864323914051056,NEUTRAL
Todd Vasos,-0.010634209029376507,NEUTRAL
Yeah  Rupesh  I would tell you from a position of strength last year  we ve positioned ourselves to be in the best position in pricing than we ve been in many  many years. And so if you take a look at our everyday pricing  we are better than we ve been across all channels of trade. And as John indicated  the promotional environment has been pretty stable and tame  and quite frankly has been that way for a year and half. So we feel pretty good about where we are  but always reserve the right  if we need to help our consumer out we ll do that. But right now  we don t see that in the near future.,0.04343177378177643,MIXED
Rupesh Parikh,-0.002619642880745232,NEUTRAL
Okay. Great. And then maybe just one follow-up question. So Todd just curious on your latest thoughts on  what you re seeing from your consumer base on your service. Because it does appear to us  I mean  it is a fairly strong consumer out there stimulus is coming. So  I just want to get your thoughts there ,0.2059508115053177,POSITIVE
Todd Vasos,-0.010634209029376507,NEUTRAL
Yeah. I would tell you the consumer   our core consumers always stretch as you know  but I have to repeat that each time  because she really is. And I would tell you that  in the last six to eight months  she s felt the stress of this pandemic probably a little bit more than she was feeling in the early part of the pandemic. And in some cases  because again lack of work  or not working that full   -hour shift to that full-time that  she was doing in many cases. So and our core consumer is probably a little bit more stretched at this point.,-0.25774019956588745,NEGATIVE
In saying that  what we have also seen though is her ability to spend when she needs to and stimulus has really helped that.,0.4620475714909844,POSITIVE
So we re in round three and as I indicated  it s very early on in that third round. We re bullish on her ability to have some extra money to spend. And we re also bullish  when we think about the back half of the year  the child tax credit piece that will be coming out for children from July through December  should also benefit our core consumer. And then  obviously  the extension of the SNAP benefit piece also helps.,-0.0027839168906211853,NEUTRAL
So there is a lot of tailwind. We just  in our guidance  didn t contemplate any of that  because again it s so -- first of all  it s so new  we just don t know how to dimensionalize it. But I think the important thing  Rupesh  to keep in mind is that we re well positioned to capture a large portion of that if she s outspending it.,0.09024788625538349,NEUTRAL
And I believe she will spend it. That is who our core consumer is. But as John said  there are other -- we re not as concerned about retail. We believe we will get more than our fair share at retail. It s just some of these other areas that are now open  whether it be dining out  whether it be travel to some degree that will be competed against. But we still feel good about being able to service her with that extra money.,0.07752196490764618,MIXED

Chandni Luthra,0.00827542383922264,NEUTRAL
Yes. Hi. Thank you for taking my questions. I wanted to talk about these new banners that you spoke of today. And especially  with pOpshelf you mentioned doing a store-within-a-store concept with signage for both pOpshelf and the Dollar General banner outside.,0.36251411330886185,POSITIVE
As you think about your core customer  what gives you confidence that the customers will not feel an alienation to the core banner with this double signage outside in a store-within-a-store concept  How do you think about that ,-0.2586735263466835,NEGATIVE
Todd Vasos,-0.010634209029376507,NEUTRAL
Yes  that s a great question. And I would tell you  first of all  our core consumer is a little bit of a different consumer than the pOpshelf consumer. But in the areas that we re looking to put these store-within-the-store concepts  it is a little higher demographic than our core.,0.2744956575334072,POSITIVE
So just to give you some color  in these areas  the demographics are more in the         to         income range versus our true Dollar General of         to         range  somewhere in there. So it s not quite the pOpshelf where it s        -plus. But I believe that the crossover  there s enough there to entice the consumer to come in.,-0.03546552360057831,NEUTRAL
The second piece of it is that  we believe that -- and we ve already proven it with some cross-pollination of items within Dollar General that were in pOpshelf and how well they sold within the box of just a true Dollar General  without even having any signage up with pOpshelf.,0.013826891779899597,POSITIVE
So  we know those same items will resonate with even our core consumers. So we believe we can capture both sides of that equation  higher end as well as continue to service the lower-end consumer with this new box.,0.18914253637194633,NEUTRAL
It is a test  right  So just keep that in mind. It will be    stores this year. But if it works and we believe it will  there could be some additional ones that we do in      and many more as we continue to move forward.,0.13806853909045458,NEUTRAL
Chandni Luthra,0.00827542383922264,NEUTRAL
Got it. And my follow-up is around new customer retention strategy that you mentioned during your third quarter call around -- some strategy around  basically  retaining those new customers. Could you give an update on that as to what you re doing to retain new customers that you gained during this time ,0.061716483905911446,NEUTRAL
Todd Vasos,-0.010634209029376507,NEUTRAL
Yes. Thank you. Well  we started that retention effort back in September. We thought it was the right time to start launching it  because we knew  because of the way we were doing it  this wasn t a pricing item retention strategy. This was a retention strategy to keep Dollar General top of mind with these newer customers. And when the pandemic starts to wane  we would keep -- Dollar General would still be in the consideration set.,0.3305484317243099,POSITIVE
So to be able to do that  it takes months to be able to instill that piece into the customer s mindset. And -- so we ve been working it hard now for the better part of five months  coming on six months. And we believe that we ve seen the benefit of that already.,0.07476416975259781,MIXED
When we saw the benefits of stimulus start to wane in November and even early December before the second wave came out  we were still seeing that repeat customer come into the store.,-0.09594893455505371,NEGATIVE
So that gave us confidence that what we were doing was working. And now  even into Q   as I mentioned earlier  we re still seeing that core customer -- or I m sorry that new customer show up within our stores. Even though the pandemic is starting to wane even a little bit more  we re still seeing that customer.,-0.11040066927671432,NEGATIVE
We will not leave the foot off the accelerator here. We believe that we ll continue to do everything we can to drive that consumer in. And as John indicated  a large part of that comp this year is predicated on retaining a good portion of those consumers  which again  we believe  we have the right to service that consumer based on what we ve seen so far.,0.0967397540807724,NEUTRAL

You ve shared a lot today. So thank you for the color. I guess maybe I d be looking for just additional details on where you are on some of your initiatives  and what we should be thinking about over the course of the next    months. Specifically  DG Fresh would love for you to elaborate there in addition to DG GO   and other ways that you are just overall kind of attacking to keep market share.,0.43174710450693965,POSITIVE
Jeff Owen,0.00024249262060038745,NEUTRAL
Hey  Paul  this is Jeff. Thank you for that question  and we are very proud of our accomplishments with DG Fresh. The team has done a fantastic job of accelerating that rollout and the capabilities that it s providing for us. So to be in        stores-plus is really an accomplishment. And originally as we talked about  DG Fresh was all about reducing product costs  improving in-stocks and a broader assortment  and we ve hit on all three. So  that is performing very well.,0.4978829499159474,POSITIVE
The other thing that we re excited about is the future and what it can potentially provide for us as we continue to grow. When you think back for a second on the formats that we ve also introduced  the reason we re able to build larger stores with more coolers  is really dependent on our strategic planning process that started several years ago and DG Fresh is a certain core to all of that.,0.35675373603589833,POSITIVE
And so  when you think about the future and our new format prototype that we re going to be moving to in the mid-part of       DG Fresh is going to play a key role in being able to continue to broaden that assortment for the customer.,0.06042618991341442,NEUTRAL
And then  as you look to the future  we also believe that DG Fresh plays a key role in unlocking our ability to do produce in over        stores as we look ahead. So  DG Fresh again  complicated initiative that the team did a phenomenal job of implementing  but is going to set us up for the future in a big way.,0.13038030080497265,NEUTRAL
On the digital side  I would say remember  on DG Pickup         stores-plus going from pilot to full rollout in less than a year  is again a tremendous accomplishment of the team.,0.4518756333272904,POSITIVE
But I will say  we continue to make great progress there and expanding the assortment. We ve optimized our substitution technology. And one thing you got to keep in mind is we re providing optionality for this customer. But  our store itself is an incredibly convenient proposition.,0.4854021461796947,POSITIVE
And when you combine being five miles within     of the population and self-checkout that we ve got in       stores right now  the convenience bar continues to rise. But  we re very pleased with what we re seeing so far there.,0.48705897794570774,POSITIVE
And then  finally I would tell you  in terms of engagement with the customer  that s the other thing on the digital side she s asking for. And with four million active users and growing  we feel real good about what we re doing there as well. So  two key initiatives that we look to continue to contribute to our future success.,0.21955013670958579,NEUTRAL

Thank you so much for that color. Just lastly  John  I appreciate the CapEx and kind of share buyback guidance. Maybe just talk about your approach to cash kind of priorities overall  and how to think about that even beyond     .,0.4967768848291598,POSITIVE
John Garratt,0.0008716667507542297,NEUTRAL
Yes. I ll start by saying our capital allocation priorities haven t changed. And the first priority remains investing in high-return growth opportunities  like new store growth remodels and the strategic initiatives that just provide fantastic returns. Then  it s still continuing to pay a competitive dividend  which we recently increased   .  . And then  it s buying back shares with the excess cash and debt capacity.,0.035168781876564026,NEUTRAL
But as we ve always noted  we want to protect our current investment grade credit rating  so we keep the leverage ratio around  . So  we bought back this year. I mean we re able to do all and buyback   .  billion of shares with the extra cash. Next year we re targeting   .  billion.,0.09460351802408695,NEUTRAL
And then  I think also meaningfully what you saw last year is we accelerated virtually every strategic initiative with the extra cash  which is again our first priority investing in the business. So  that served us very well and remains unchanged.,0.42063262476585805,POSITIVE

First  an overview of our business  starting with our investment highlights on Slide  . Desktop Metal is the only pure-play additive manufacturing  .  company. We are pioneering a new generation of additive manufacturing technologies focused on the production of end-use products to help businesses make high performance products faster  more sustainably in a cost and volume competitive with conventional manufacturing processes. The additive manufacturing market is a significant and growing opportunity that s expected to go from roughly     billion in      to about      billion by     . This   x growth is being propelled by a shift from prototyping and tooling into mass production applications and the industry has strong secular tailwind around onshoring and supply chain flexibility.,0.04733481000585016,NEUTRAL
We have a growing portfolio of additive manufacturing  .  solutions focused on volume production of end use parts that we think has industry leading price performance and capabilities across the portfolio  with over     materials qualified across polymers  metals  ceramics  composites and biocompatible resins. Our products include some of the largest and fastest DLP systems in the market with the Envision One HT and the Xtreme  K and we have got the fastest metal printer in the market with a Production System P-  . It s about     times faster than product generation technology cycles are part of the future. We have also got a series of developing businesses in composites and biofabrication that we are going to expand as I will discuss shortly.,0.10920629002794158,NEUTRAL
This portfolio is backed by differentiated technology modes. That includes printers  software materials in over     patents issued or pending. We have a second major mode around distribution. And we now have over     partners in    countries around the world. We are doubling down on a combination of horizontal and vertical focus. We are the channel to go after a variety of markets. We have got a solid dental and jewelry business and we will continue to expand our focus into verticals such as healthcare  automotive  aerospace and oil and gas. We have got a very compelling financial profile. The products I highlighted earlier each have high margin recurring revenue streams from receivables and service  which generate a multiple of the upfront revenue and gross profit over the lifetime of the system.,0.23112808068981394,NEUTRAL
On the whole  we anticipate significant gross margin improvements and operating leverage as we scale revenue over time. And finally  we believe there is a significant inorganic upside potential in the business. And we have got a team with experience executing transactions. We have ended the year with a very robust liquidity profile. And we expect to use this to fund organic activities  but also generate a return as we add strategic capabilities to the business in line with a strategy focused on enabling killer apps for additive.,0.10981172928586602,NEUTRAL
Taking a step back  you look at the additive manufacturing industry as a whole on Slide    today  a small percentage of the spend in a program goes to design prototypes  tooling and jigs and fixtures. These use cases has traditionally been the focus of additive manufacturing. This actually used to be an industry called rapid prototyping  but the vast majority of the spending in a program really goes to the end use parts in production.,0.007725803647190332,NEUTRAL
Turning to Slide    if you take additive manufacturing  or AM to mass production  there is four key hurdles  each has a high bar given the maturity of conventional manufacturing processes. In the polymer space  for example  surface finish has traditionally been a barrier. I mean parts that look and feel like end use parts or the polymer AM has created this hurdle  but for a long time  the parts didn t have the required accuracy. Today  there are residents available that fully cured during printing. So  you can achieve the finish and accuracy needed to go to market with AM parts. Material properties is also a recent area of innovation with multicolor resins  which now enable making parts from materials that level or exceed widely available thermoplastics. And finally  beads have gradually been increasing since about      primarily through continuous printing  which we patented and they are now reaching a point where you can use photopolymer AM production in high volumes. The story is very similar in the metal side  where over time technology advances have cleared each of these bars. The key hurdle we at  DM  are now addressing the speed and cost where throughput has historically emitted the use of metal AM  because parts and systems have not been cost effective.,0.10857498634140939,NEUTRAL
Turning to Slide    we are focused on print processes with productivity that continues to improve over time  writing semiconductor scaling loss. In metals  we have got the fastest binder jetting systems in the market. The engine that drives the throughput is inkjet  which has doubled in throughput every roughly    to    months. For the past    years  by improving nozzle density and droplet firing frequency  whereas vector-based print processes typically require more time or more cost to scale through. An area-wide process that gains efficiencies over time like our proprietary single pass jetting technology drives the economics of additive down the cost curve to make it competitive with conventional manufacturing and volumes up to hundreds of thousands of units per day and even larger volumes as the new generation print engine is introduced.,0.06766679446445778,NEUTRAL
On Slide    we see the same thing happening in photopolymers  with the move to UV diodes as a light source for curing. EnvisionTEC s photopolymer printers have scaled speed roughly every    months as new generations of diodes come out. Now  you have got their new patented approach called projection arrays  which multiplies improvements in power output enables sprint speeds to scale it even faster. Resolution has also had scaling with rapid advancements in underlying image projection technology. This allows you to have larger built platforms with more parts. The result of all this is that our photopolymer printers can now use these improvements in power and resolution to shift further the cost curve making at-scale printing of end use polymer parts viable. With this focus on technologies that ride third-party improvements in efficiency and power  we have the wind behind our sales and we anticipate growing more competitive with conventional manufacturing each year.,0.12677145120687783,NEUTRAL
Turning to Slide    additive manufacturing  .  or AM  .  represents this next generation of technologies that enables volume production of end use parts with finish  accuracy  properties and economics that are actually competitive with conventional manufacturing. The AM market has compounded at     annually over the last decade to     billion by     . In the last   years before       it actually compounded at     annually. We think the market overall exhibited a strong bounce back from COVID-   in the fourth quarter and that points to a promising year ahead. And the industry is expected to continue to compound at roughly     over the next decade to get to      billion by     . This inflection is really being driven by more and more businesses shifting towards end use parts powered by AM  . . And that      billion only represents    penetration of the overall     trillion in the global manufacturing industry. So there is plenty of room to continue to grow.,0.07165221287868917,NEUTRAL
Turning to Slide    the reason so many businesses are looking to use additive for end-use parts is that it eliminates the need for tooling  which has created significant pain points in conventional manufacturing. For example  long lead times  minimum volume requirements  time sensitive machine programming  and significant material waste. Conventional manufacturing also creates design limitations that can negatively impact performance and cost in favor of manufacturability. Additive enables benefits like the ability to design complex parts using generative design tools that optimized for real world physics or assembly consolidation  which takes many components and prints them as a single part with dramatic efficiencies on weight or performance or mass customization of parts to particular markets or environments. Finally  reengineering supply chains are on demand  flexible manufacturing capacity and digital inventories  where businesses ship files across borders for local manufacturing. There is a dramatic opportunity to reshape global commerce and improve CO  footprints as we develop more efficient ways to mass produce and ship products to consumers. And these are key long-term tailwinds for AM  . .,0.02343460894189775,NEUTRAL
I would like to spend some time to highlight some exciting initial applications that are becoming cost effective with our AM  .  solutions. In the past  you have probably heard of additive being used for very high end  very low volume parts like genetic components. I think one of the problems with additive is it costs too much to be used at scale in larger markets. One of the more exciting things about our solutions is that we can now use AM  .  technologies to make hundreds of thousands of parts in applications that you never would have considered using additive for in the past.,0.08668422512710094,NEUTRAL
On Slide     you can see one of our customers  for example  a company called E.A.C. in France. They are a major supplier of metal accessories for swimwear  cosmetics and luxury goods for companies such as Chanel and Louis Vitton. More and more  they are using our shop system to mass produce pieces they can end up in stores that you as a consumer could go to and purchase. That is a fantastic  fantastic development for additive. They have received their system middle of last quarter and it s already making parts in high volume. The shop system helped E.A.C increase their hardware production from        pieces per week to more than        parts per week. Those are real manufacturing numbers. Tens of thousands of pieces per week  shop system also allows them to create volume quantities of these accessories  which significantly reduced lead times  which is important in the fashion industry and minimal to no manual assembly required. This is a game changer for an SME business like this that s supplying end-use parts to a market. And it illustrates several core benefits of the shop system biogenic solution  turnkey flexible manufacturing  volume production of real end-use parts with faster time to market and the ability to get up and running quickly with minimal prior binder jetting experience. As a plug and play solution  it s extremely easy to install and deploy.,0.4326828949851915,POSITIVE
On Slide     another exciting case study is with one of our P-  customers  FreeFORM Technologies. They have got a very experienced team in Pennsylvania and are dedicating themselves to making parts with metal binder jetting. To the P-   the part quality and throughput has enabled them to continually gain business with their customers fulfilling small quantities of parts at first and then go into a large volume and because it s a digital manufacturing process that can economically turnaround thousands of parts in   to   weeks versus   to   months with conventional manufacturing or older generation AM systems at     to     reduction in lead time. On top of supporting direct material and process transfers to flagship production  P-    the P-  is a great tool for high-speed serial production of small and complex parts.,0.3282524653477594,POSITIVE
Turning to Slide     since the fourth quarter  we also entered a fast growing photopolymer additive market  with our acquisition of EnvisionTEC  the original inventor of digital light processing  or DLP printing  an area wide photopolymer  D printing process. They have significant blocking IP in this segment  which has bolstered our DM patent portfolio. Together  we created a one-stop shop for AM  .  solutions across polymers and metals. What we are excited about with EnvisionTEC is that their solutions have been used to produce end use parts at scale  with over    million parts in      alone. They are market leader in fast growing segments like dental with sales of their Envision One platform grew over  x in      despite the challenges from COVID-  . EnvisionTEC gives us a fantastic platform as we expand the business to reach a whole new set of verticals and applications that benefit from polymer parts and volume. And on top of this  we grow our channel in both number and geographic reach with great opportunity for cross-selling metal and polymer solutions.,0.15606737101916224,NEUTRAL
Looking at the product portfolio as a whole on Slide     we feel it s the most compelling and diverse set of AM  .  solutions in the market and it can cater to metals  composites  ceramics  photopolymers  and even include digital casting and bio-printing capabilities. And what s great is that it can address use cases across a product lifecycle from preproduction all the way to volume end use parts. This is a killer product lineup. Almost all of these products have been refreshed and released during the last year and we believe they can take us to significant scale. They are backed by a very strong IP portfolio of over     issued and pending patents and supported by a library of over     materials. To build these products  we really had to pioneer a set of disruptive technologies.,0.4851965836714953,POSITIVE
On Slide    now  Single Pass Jetting is the patent pending technology that powers our production system platform. Unlike competitive binder jetting systems  which typically require    to    seconds to print a layer  the production system P-  and P-   can print a letter in under   seconds. This equates to build speeds that are up to     times faster than part of a fusion and significantly faster than conventional binder jetting. The P-   can support production of up to millions of parts annually at costs that are competitive with conventional manufacturing at reasonable volumes and this is really key because business won t adopt additive if it can compete on cost. The production system platform offers the only inner processing environment in the market. So we are actually able to print reactive materials we have binder jet. As an example with great announcement last week on a breakthrough in the development of aluminum for binder jetting  where we have collaborated with our partners to achieve extremely promising results of over     dense      aluminum material with properties better than lot with comparable heat treatment.,0.07853185814747121,NEUTRAL
On the metal side  we have also got advanced print technology was developed in-house to be affordable and easy to install. It makes binder jetting an accessible turnkey solution that can be adopted rapidly by businesses and individuals without experience with printing or metallurgy. Both of these technologies are enabled by life center  our proprietary sintering simulation software designed to improve our accuracy and eliminate the trial and error for powder metallurgy based additive manufacturing. It dynamically stimulates the sintering step of a binder jetting process to predict shrinkage and distortion  incorrect geometries before printing to minimize any deviations from the intended design of the final part. This software tool will be a key enabler for broad adoption of binder jetting.,0.27449271161458455,POSITIVE
Turning to Slide     on the photopolymer side  we have a unique patented technology in continuous digital ad manufacturing. This is an extremely cost effective solution for mass production of photopolymer parts that uses proprietary domeless basement technology to provide higher accuracy prints than membrane alternatives. The Envision One HT  which began shipping in the first quarter of       is the only commercially available high temperature high viscosity photopolymer system shipping in volume today. And we think this is the future in photopolymer AM. This technology allows businesses to achieve properties on par or exceeding conventional thermoplastics. And these systems are doing extremely well. On the right here is the new Xtreme  K solution  which uses patented protection array technology to achieve native  K resolution and effective   L resolution at very high speeds. It s the most advanced polymer AM system in the market compared to an industrial Fortus     FDM printer from Stratasys. This system is up to    x faster with a build envelope that s roughly the same size. And it offers superior price performance to comparable industrial polymer AM systems. And just like the Envision One HT  it supports high temperature  high viscosity resins to enable a wide variety of industrial commercial applications.,0.17446833295980468,NEUTRAL
Digging into our go-to-market on Slide     we have got a leading global distribution network today  with over     partners that can sell and service our solutions in over    countries around the world. Our partners address a wide variety of markets and include vertically focused players as well as the ones focused on general industrial businesses. They can support a variety of business models and product offerings whether it s low touch high volume or high touch high value. We think this is one of the differentiating assets of DM as a company. And we believe this will be a key factor in accelerating our growth to achieve global scale and launch new products efficiently.,0.11672826345602516,NEUTRAL
Turning to Slide     we have got a very broad adoption of our AM  .  technologies across a variety of industries in both polymers and metals  healthcare  automotive  aerospace  oil and gas and consumer products  diversified manufacturers and machine shops. We are excited to expand this user base to more blue chip customers and SMEs as we continue to ramp production in distribution over our newer solutions.,0.14838432625401765,NEUTRAL
Turning to Slide     the unit economics of these products are fantastic. The two examples here are the production system  P-   and the Xtreme  K. The lifetime revenue and gross profit of each system is a multiple of the initial sale  roughly  x to   .  million in the case of a P-   and upwards of   x to   .  billion with the Xtreme  K. The current contribution comes from the sale of high margin consumables and services  which result in strong gross margin profiles over the life of the system  but they really demonstrate a pretty attractive razor  razor blade model  where the initial sale generates a profit as well.,0.4216321522835642,POSITIVE
Turning for a moment to our strategy related to inorganic growth on Slide     there is an opportunity here as we continue to build out a strong distribution channel to bring new technologies on the printer side that are focused on AM  . . There is a lot of innovation in the private sector and we look forward to adding new print capabilities to our company to enable a wider set of applications and use cases. The second vector for inorganic growth is materials  where we see a huge opportunity to benefit from vertical integration. We have already built vertically integrated structure for materials in the photopolymer side  where we also have an open certified materials business model to work with partners with unique materials outside our moat to offer validated third-party solutions to customers.,0.11711199925048277,NEUTRAL
On the metal side vertically integrating into advanced materials difficult for conventional manufacturing could uplift the lifetime value of a P-   customer by up  x to  x. The third vector for inorganic growth is building a strong parts offering around killer app where our focus is to incorporate businesses and segments with high margin high barriers to entry. And you will see more about our strategy in this area as the year progresses and we have secured some of these transactions. We believe this can be very accretive to the company and provide a strong return on capital as in the case with EnvisionTEC. Now  there are already several markets which have been quick to adopt AM at scale and we are going to focus on building go-to-market strategies about each of these segments. Hearing aids  for example  is an application that has almost fully crossed over into additive. The same goes for jewelry where AM is used widely for creating wax molds for casting and now starting to be used for direct metal printing.,0.07504967704880983,NEUTRAL
Turning to Slide     today  we are now seeing the creation of a new business called Desktop Health focused on patient-specific additive manufacturing solutions for the healthcare and dental markets. To help lead this initiative  we are bringing on board Mike Jafar  who had a historic career at Evolus in Allergan  launching some of the best known brands in the healthcare space. We feel there are commercial ready applications in dental  orthopedics  audiology and surgical instruments  but there is also a lot of exciting potential in our untapped categories. And we look forward to working with Mike and his team to evolve solutions for these applications and bring them to the market using our DLP  high speed metal binder jetting in Bioplotter solutions. Our vision here is that today you have got more than     billion of medical implants annually and they are mostly produce in standard manufactured sizes. We think that s going to change over the next decade or two where most of these parts will become patient specific and that s a major opportunity for additive manufacturing across metals  polymers  ceramics and all materials.,0.2337811758479802,NEUTRAL
On Slide     dental is one of the killer apps for additive manufacturing. It s a segment that has been patient specific for some time now since every part is custom. It s a market that s both growing and adopting additive quite rapidly. However  with more than     billion in annual parts and spend in dental  only a small percentage of that total is printed. Most central parts today are still milled are made by hand in the lab. We see an excellent opportunity for additive to reach up to     by      and we plan to be a major enabler of AM adoption in the ortho  lab in terms of dental markets. Materials are key to enabling applications in this market. You can see how many different use cases for AM there are in polymers  metals and ceramics. We have got several materials that have either received FDA     k  clearance or are in process  including proprietary materials for permanent crowns and full arch implant dentures with industry leading performance.,0.22457237885100767,NEUTRAL
Turning on to Slide     we believe the future is to have processes that take less time where you can remove the temporary steps. An example is full arch implant dentures  which is a procedure that today takes an average   weeks from beginning to end. Enabled by our breakthrough proprietary materials and combined with our high speed printers  we developed with our partners a revolutionary same day digital workflow for full arch implant dentures. This new  D printed smile takes place in a single day under the comfort of IV sedation. And this will be one of several initial solutions that we will bring to market with Desktop Health.,0.13334608549484983,NEUTRAL
Our materials and process have been tested in a clinical study conducted in coordination with leading partners in the field in participation from roughly     patients this March     . Since then  there have been no failures with our printed implant dentures and the results overall have been excellent. This application is part of roughly    billion dental implant market  where we feel there is potential to completely revolutionize how patients are treated and this is all enabled by a combination of advanced materials in both metals and polymers with really high-quality properties and AM technologies suitable for end use part production. We look forward to building a best-in-class team in healthcare and dental to work with our partners in industry to bring patient specific solutions to the market at scale  not just in dental  but also across cardiology  orthopedics  ophthalmology  dermatology and plastic surgery.,0.43114966653229203,POSITIVE
Now  turning to our fourth quarter business highlights on Slide   . As I mentioned earlier  we made several key strides in the fourth quarter towards commercializing our AM  .  technology platform. We started global shipments of our Shop System  a mass market binder jetting solution for SMEs and machine shops. It s a full turnkey offering designed for flexible mid volume production. Based on published figures  in just one quarter in the market  Shop System became the number one selling binder system in terms of units. In addition  we begin global shipments of our production system  P-  solution  the entry level model for our production system platform. It s also a great proof point on our path to commercializing the production system  P-   in the second half of      as to show the same technology architecture and corporate modules. We are incredibly proud of our dedicated team of employees that helped us achieve these key product launches in spite of the challenges and disruptions created by COVID-   during     .,0.04849906660092529,NEUTRAL
Among our commercialization products  we gain adoption from key customers such as Milwaukee Tool  Ford  Eaton  Pratt and Whitney  and more. We also launched our sintering simulation software live center  for using our binder jetting solutions and received significant awards from the Department of Defense. We beefed up our Board of Directors with the addition of Scott Dussault as Veteran CFO and Steve Nigro  who used to be President of HP s printing and imaging business.,0.04991009720833972,NEUTRAL

Thanks  Ric and thanks again to everyone for joining us today. I am James Haley  the CFO of Desktop Metal. I am pleased for this opportunity to share Desktop Metal s financial results for the first time as a public company. I will begin with a quick recap for those new to Desktop Metal before providing a summary of the company s fourth quarter and full year results for      and closing with guidance for       which can be found on Slide   . We announced a definitive business combination agreement with Trine Acquisition Corp on August          concurrently with a successful PIPE fundraise that in aggregate provided approximately      million of net proceeds to our balance sheet. The business combination was completed on December   and we began trading on the NYSE on the   th under the ticker symbol  DM.,0.32488691138860304,POSITIVE
Moving to our financial results for the fourth quarter and full year of       we are pleased with our fourth quarter results  which reflected an inflection point in our business as we successfully commenced shipments of several new products. We generated revenue of   .  million for the fourth quarter of       up from   .  million in the third quarter and in line with our expectation of sequential acceleration. Casting sales in the fourth quarter was     million resulting in gross margin of negative    . This represents a sharp improvement from the third quarter of      as we began to scale revenue out of our fixed overhead costs as well as a shift towards higher margin products.,0.3880527061846806,POSITIVE
Net loss for the fourth quarter was    .  million  which includes increased G A expenses related to our transaction with Trine and becoming a public company  including additional headcount for corporate functions  audit  legal  professional services and insurance. Looking at the year overall  revenue for fiscal      was    .  million. Net loss and non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA for the fiscal year were negative    .  million and negative    .  million respectively. We ended the year with a well-capitalized balance sheet  including cash  cash equivalents and short-term investments of     .  million as of December         .,-0.12796531338244677,NEUTRAL
On February           with more than     of the public warrants from the transaction with Trine already exercised  we announced redemption of the remaining outstanding public warrants. Through March              .  million public warrants were exercised for cash  resulting in proceeds of     .  million. Looking ahead to      with our robust capital position  we plan to hit the accelerator on growth and we will continue to make substantial investments in both organic and inorganic opportunities. Over the past few months  we have significantly expanded our sales and marketing  engineering and administrative teams to ensure we are well positioned to fast track organic growth. Further  we are building out internal M A capabilities to support the multiple inorganic growth initiatives  which Ric spoke to earlier.,0.056601093005156144,NEUTRAL
For the full year       we expect to generate revenue in excess of      million  including contribution from EnvisionTEC. We plan to exit the year with an annualized revenue run-rate of at least      million with multiple product launches from the fourth quarter right in the rearview mirror and additional commercial launches this year with EnvisionTEC Xtreme  K and Envision One HT in the first half and the production system P-   in the second half  we anticipate sequential growth to be relatively modest in the first quarter  followed by a more substantial acceleration beginning in the second quarter as various growth initiatives take effect following COVID and as these new solutions pickup steam. Turning to adjusted EBITDA on a non-GAAP basis  we expect this to be in the range of negative     million to     million as we continue to invest in organic and inorganic growth.,0.012636104132980108,NEUTRAL

Hey  Shannon. Thank you for the question. I think we have great funnel that s building for our products. We didn t get to ship our Shop System until probably middle or second half of the fourth quarter and the traditional COVID supply chain related thing  so moving things around the world  but we did a global launch in all continents  which I think was a strategic thing for us to get going on our Shop System and we did that to prevent potential limitations of different places that we didn t know whether they would be locked down or not. Overall  we are pretty happy with the results given all the traditional challenges that our companies faced to get products delivered around the world. And I think that as we come out of pandemic  we are going to see some great resurgence and people going back to their labs and manufacturing spaces to execute programs  so.,0.46630583226215094,POSITIVE

Really  we are trying to hit the accelerator on growth here and that s going to be achieved certainly with multiple organic and inorganic opportunities. We touched on with building out an internal M A capability  certainly our organic sales team  the EnvisionTEC sales team  marketing  continued efforts on research and development looking at various cost-down initiatives as well as future products and then all the integration of multiple opportunities we are looking at. I will add too certainly the public company expenses we are not something that was sort of contemplated in some of the numbers prior. Those numbers are certainly substantial.

Yes  thanks. Good morning and congrats on all the achievements thus far. I guess maybe just kind of starting at a high level and I am really looking at the product portfolio specific to Desktop  but help us understand raking in order of importance studio versus shop versus production.

No  it definitely will expect some contribution from P-   this year in the second half and that continues to be on schedule. P-  and the Shop System are important parts of our product portfolio as they are mass production systems as well as our Shop System. Studio is a product that has to be finished. And we are very excited about our Studio  . On the photopolymer side  the Envision One is very much a hit product. It is doing extremely well in the market and in the particularly in dental labs of all the segments we continue to see significant traction and adoption on it as well as for D K for chairside and it s   we think the products are fantastic.

Got it. And just going back to the commentary on the Q  assumptions  I guess I am just a little bit confused still. So  it sounds like in Q   there were still some kind of COVID related headwinds and maybe some push-outs in terms of timing  I guess  looking at the revenue guide  I thought maybe given some of those new product introductions  then obviously  you have got contribution from EnvisionTEC that revenue would have jumped or at least the guy that would have suggested a revenue jump more sequentially.

James Haley,0.0006096235229051672,NEUTRAL
I mean  we have got a strategy we laid out earlier during our original roadshow and just reiterate it  we plan to continue to be active in M A. However  it is something that we do selectively. We acquire things that give us new capabilities in either print modalities for AM  .  or vertically integrated into materials or consumables that our systems use  particular in high volume production applications. And then on the product side  we have got a strategy to enabling printing of difficult to manufacture materials  which require specialized processing as well as killer apps where their significant IP or high margin markets. And so we are going to continue to execute that and you would see transactions in the future as that goes on. I would say  we looked at a lot of business opportunities. It s not uncommon for companies that just went through   what we went through to see a lot of things and so we are very selective in what we actually move forward with  but we are excited about the things that we have got in front of us and think we can do very accretive transactions.,0.02681050170212984,NEUTRAL

Ric Fulop,0.000941040285397321,NEUTRAL
Absolutely. So  the health opportunity is massive. Today  most parts that are used in healthcare are not patient specific  with the exception of dentistry  where the clips are made by hand for patients. So  when you buy a graft or an implant  it s traditionally something that was producing      or    sizes and then the surgeons try to match it at the time of surgery. And I think that a decade or two from now  everything will be patient specific and based on everything  probably with the exception of trauma  which needs real-time inventory. But I think that  that presents a very unique opportunity to develop a core competency in the business and we are building a world class go-to-market team that s going to develop clear products as well as help our partners in the healthcare industry adopt this technology at scale. We are going to be very creative in the types of products that we are going to help our partners bring to market. And I am excited to share those as we evolve it  but I think it s going to be a very vibrant part of our business  I expect it to be at least a third of our business in the long run. So  it s a great area where end use products can do very well. And I think you will see the healthcare industry adopt additive at scale over the next decade.,0.1767184818163514,NEUTRAL

Ric Fulop,0.000941040285397321,NEUTRAL
Yes  it continues to grow. I think we have a great synergy between our P-  and P-  . Most customers that buy a P-  no longer want to have a P-  . So  it s an on-ramp to that platform. It was actually developed in concert with a major customer who bought a P-    but need a P-  type machine in order to qualify materials and parts without having to get a P-   like machine sort of pulled from production in order to do a qualification of our components. So  if you are going to mass produce  if you are a large company  you have got        SKUs        SKUs that you would want to print  you need a platform to qualify those while you have got the large CapEx printing     . And that s how we see the synergy between those two architectures  settings or qualification that you are doing on P-  translate to      to a P-  . They have the same modules and the same inkjet systems  the same recording process. So  it s a one-to-one and we validated that with some of our customers that have both installed beta of P-   and have received the P- . And I think that P-  is a much small machine. So  it s easier to install and deploy  but it s a great platform  it s going to help us mature that technology to the point where it s you have got high OEE by the time we deploy your P-   into the market later this year. So  we are excited about how those two systems play together.,-0.057553090155124664,MIXED

And then just with regard to the EnvisionTEC acquisition subsequent acquisitions you guys might do here  how do we think about the long-term targets  I understand you don t want to update us every quarter  but you have got a lot of dry powder here to execute additional M A. How should we think of those long-term targets maybe versus some of the inorganic opportunities you are pursuing ,-0.11361957713961601,NEUTRAL
Ric Fulop,0.000941040285397321,NEUTRAL
I think there are   I mean  obviously  you would have to update the models when we do the transactions. Some of the companies we are going to acquire are more technically oriented and sort of capabilities on our technology that would allow us to have future products. And some of them are companies that have some scale like EnvisionTEC and an installed base that we are then going to provide additional distribution or help us scale faster. So  I think that depends on the transaction. And we have several things that we are working on. So as we execute them  we would love to explain the opportunity and why we did  what we did and then I think there is a great opportunity in bringing AM  .  technologies into the market. One thing that I think is a focus of us is we are not going to do any acquisitions on sort of tooling or take some pictures or things that we would consider AM  . . I mean  our market grew in sort of a rapid prototyping tooling type of world and our company is      focused on mass production of end use parts. So there is a lot of folks that would like to claim that there is the same thing  but there is sort of two ways of playing this market. One is to take a technology that s helped patents  for example  like FDM and develop a more modern version of that for smaller markets like tooling and jigs and fixtures. Another one is to really tackle the issue of how do you go to mass production at scale with additive and we are      focused on what we call AM  .   which is the production of additive parts at scale  at a lower cost structure than conventional manufacturing  where the economics are the driver. So  that s      the focus on the company and all of our M A strategies and execution focus is geared towards making additive cost effective. The systems cost too much today to bring to market and older technologies is not cost effective on a cost per part basis. So  the focus on the company is      on the combination of techniques that give you a combination of surface finish  accuracy  material properties and throughput  so you can actually go to market with  D printing.,0.015700641088187695,NEUTRAL

The one point I would add is the first part of your question and that is the long-term thesis is intact and we are doing everything we can to accelerate it responsibly. So  to highlight Ric s point  I mean  we are in the business of acquiring long-term technology that s really going to help us in our short-term revenue and accretion. So  hopefully later this year  we will be in a position to provide some updates on the longer term model  but as we sit here exiting Q   we don t think it s the right time to do it.,0.05038243252784014,NEUTRAL

Hey  Ric and thanks for taking my question. So  this kind of ties into the last question  but I am just trying to reconcile  the      either the guidance we are talking about the time of the fact. And so I was just trying to understand sort of if you look at that bridge  how much of that is coming from EnvisionTEC versus some kind of continued headwinds associated with COVID as we look from I think going from around roughly     million loss  including some of those public company costs versus the guidance you provided. So  could you help me just understand how to think about that ,-0.10390635207295418,NEUTRAL
James Haley,0.0006096235229051672,NEUTRAL
Sure. So certainly  the public company cost  as I mentioned  are substantially higher than I think what we first thought. Beyond that  I really view it as additional investment in the business  I mean  really as I stated with near      million of dry powder  we could essentially just go status quo when   and leave their funds in the bank near zero interest. But instead  we are doing everything we can to accelerate some of those longer term financial targets. So  that is how I would be thinking about it. In terms of EnvisionTEC  no  that is not really a drain on EBITDA  if you will  it s a transaction that  as I mentioned  our primary focus is to acquire good technology with EnvisionTEC  we certainly got that. We did also get some good stable revenues and a healthy bottom line as well. So  really  it s more about accelerating the growth story.,-0.17949580028653145,NEGATIVE

Okay  just wanted to make sure I understood that. And then  obviously  at the time of the EnvisionTEC acquisition  you talked a lot about the growth profile and how you are thinking about contributions  but maybe you could speak to  if you have kind of worked more with the company and started an efficient if there is any change in how you are thinking about growth over say the next   years  And then kind of related to the last question  I understand you kind of said  you are maybe not in the point where you could talk about the longer term business models  but maybe going back to the EBITDA question  if you would be comfortable kind of talking about generally when you are thinking about maybe hitting a breakeven point or maybe profitability  Thanks.,-0.165726313367486,NEUTRAL

As I think about revenue for the full year  I would say roughly     as we sit today is going to be on the organic DM side with     would be in EnvisionTEC. That said going forward  it s not something that we really plan to talk about as these products are going to be fully and teams are going to be integrated to really maximize our sales  if you will.

As commented during previous releases  this unprecedented global emergency translated into a strong deterioration of the market context  impacting negatively demand and triggering a severe devaluation of currencies. FX represented the main headwind to our      results and worth around    billion at EBITDA level. LatAm currencies devaluated by     on average over the year  with Brazilian reais as one of the currencies that has weaken the most.,-0.05405175359919667,NEUTRAL

I will show in the next slide  the impact of business headwinds. We are now on Slide number   . The group s EBITDA was mainly affected by the following negative impacts  as I said  around    billion from the devaluation of currencies  and      million associated with COVID-   dynamics related to the sharp contraction of volumes for roughly      million  impacting retail activities worldwide and networks in LatAm  and other dynamics mainly associated with losses  downing processes and delays in investments and developments for around      million.

Let s now comment group EBITDA  and I m on Slide number   . As already commented  the reported EBITDA    .   flat year-on-year and showing a solid improvement of the underlying operating performance despite the adverse scenario. On generation  the new renewable capacity developed has driven the operating performance  while the management of generation margins  together with our retail portfolio  continued to protect the economic results against market fluctuations.,0.13194228243082762,NEUTRAL

Now we will move in a deeper analysis  and now we are on Page    on Global Power Generation  where we take -- on Page     we take a look at the performance of the Global Power Generation s division. And in the following slides  we will go more in detail through the performance of energy power and conventional generation.,0.038084418105427176,NEUTRAL
Overall  the Global Power Generation ordinary EBITDA stood at around    million      higher versus the same period of last year. Excluding the negative impact of FX  performance was up by     year-on-year. The unitary gross margin increased by    from   .   to   .    as you can see in the chart. And this improved profitability comes from a higher share of renewables in the mix compared to one year ago.,0.16879687272012234,NEUTRAL
Worth to remind you that last year  performance included around      million of capital gain associated with the full consolidation of our North American assets as well as      million of positive contribution associated with the early termination of a PPA contract in Chile. In addition  as already commented during the previous releases  the period has been positively affected by a provision reversal in Spain for around      million  mainly booked within conventional generation.,0.054106283001601696,NEUTRAL
And now we ll go a deep dive on Enel Green Power  and we move on Slide   . Ordinary EBITDA stood at   .  billion     higher versus last year. As mentioned in the previous slide       was also positively affected by the capital gain associated with the full consolidation of North American assets and the early termination of PPA contract in Chile  the overall impact in      was      million. So the underlying operating performance is up      million  taking into account also this one-off.,-0.048845112323760986,NEUTRAL
And so the main items of this      million are a positive contribution of      million coming from the additional capacity installed in       mainly in U.S. and Brazil. And worth to highlight that around  .  gigawatts commissioned in the last quarter have not yet fully contributed the results and will generate around      million EBITDA in     .,0.07118643610738218,NEUTRAL

Net of nonrecurring items booked in the period  the performance would have recorded a minus   .

These items were partially offset by the positive contribution of efficiencies for      million  mainly in Italy and Spain.,-0.39120751176960766,NEGATIVE
On the other side  trading activities  impacted also by the dynamics associated with the COVID-    have been the key driver of the double-digit increase in this business segment  contributing for around      million  mainly thanks to the management of our gas portfolio for around      million  the managing of the short position in Spain that impacted positively for      million  and a positive contribution for around      million associated with trading activities  mainly in Italy.,0.02093765279278159,NEUTRAL
Let s now take a look at our infrastructure network  and I m on Slide   . Ordinary EBITDA for networks stood at   .  billion  decreasing    versus last year. In the European countries  EBITDA increased by     demonstrating  once again  the resiliency of our European networks  which have been supported by solid regulatory frameworks. In LatAm  despite the recovery in demand recorded in the second half of the year  the operating performance has been negatively impacted by FX and volumes contraction  mainly in Brazil.,0.034630030393600464,NEUTRAL
As said in the previous releases  discussion with regulators in LatAm  are ongoing  and we expect other actions to be taken to offset the economic impact.

Looking closely at the EBITDA of the free and regulated market  free market EBITDA declined for around      million or    year-on-year  and this is mainly attributable to a temporary loan position  driven by a sharp contraction in volumes in Italy and Spain. In Italy  EBITDA remained flat year-on-year  recovering from the negative result recorded in the nine months  driven by a pickup of volumes in the B B segment in the last quarter of the year  with average unitary margins for both B B and B C broadly unchanged.,-0.03415868058800697,NEUTRAL
In Iberia  EBITDA declined by     or more than      million  driven mainly by the already commented temporary long position impact. In Romania  retail EBITDA increased by     million or two times. Regulated market EBITDA increased by    year-on-year or around     million. And finally  we recorded efficiencies for     million  both in the free and regulated market  mainly in Italy.,0.026595283299684525,NEUTRAL
Now we have gone through business drivers  and now we can move to the financial management section. We are on Slide   .

D A declined versus previous year as a consequence of a lower depreciation in Italy  Iberia and Chile  thanks to the coal impairments  which more than offset the increase in bad debt accruals due to COVID-   pandemic and investment deployed. Reduction in financial expenses  as already commented in the previous releases  is the result of a reduction of cost of debt. Results from equity investments stood at      million.,-0.1087405956350267,NEUTRAL
The remarkable swing vis- -vis last year is attributable to the negative impact of around     million from JMB unwinding in the U.S. recorded in      and improving results of other nonconsolidated companies  primarily open fiber.

In more details  the dynamics underlying the FFO evolution can be summarized as follow  EBITDA in line change in provision  which increased by around     million  mainly due to higher bad debt accruals for COVID-  . On working capital  it s worth to highlight that we have almost fully recovered the    billion impact due to the pandemic as shown during the first half results call. This leaves us only      million negative delta working capital at the end of       which will be reabsorbed in early     .

Free cash flow stood at   .  billion  confirming the ability of the group to cover the capital expenditure with the operating cash generation. And now on Page     we have a look on the net debt level. Net debt is equal to    .  billion  well below the level communicated at the Capital Market Day  mainly thanks to the positive FX impact from the devaluation of local currencies and the different timing of hybrid bond equity and equity accounting conversion.,0.05778895749244839,NEUTRAL
Changes are driven by the positive free cash flow of  .   dividends paid for   .  billion  cash outflows related to equities swaps performed of Enel Am ricas and Enel Chile  hybrid bonds accounted as equity and positive impact from FX of about   .  billion  the reduction in gross debt from   .  to  .   is attributable to the accounting provided bonds as equity  while the reduction in cash in the period is related to the financing of      activities performed in late     .,0.009514846839010715,NEUTRAL

I will start from the first one to the CEO. I think he s one of the most popular. So far       has seen some doubt on renewable  which led to a rebalancing and sell-off of the most exposed names. Can you share with us your view on the sector and our returns going forward ,0.0026726052165031433,NEUTRAL
Francesco Starace,0.00044685402826871723,NEUTRAL
Okay. There are basically two questions here is -- two observations. One is the one on the dynamic of prices and competition  with one on the  let s say  share performance of some players. I think there is some technical adjustments that took place. There are some technical adjustments that took place with the rebalancing of the indexes.,0.0023574428632855415,MIXED
I think the markets seem to have switched quite quickly the sentiment also on the back of some business events that were kind of surprising during the year. I think the key common conclusion deriving from this event is that the returns may not be at par with the expectation  and that delivery in terms of capacity commission might not be in line with targets communicated by several players.,-0.05002580303698778,MIXED
Now let me recall some of the measures  some of the messages that we set out when we delivered our Capital Market Day. The first one is that the dimension and the expansion of the space in renewables is such that it can accommodate for all the relevant players today and more. And that it does not really have any threat of becoming congested or crowded space. So there is not an issue on space of growth. And we didn t see any change during the      year. Prices will go down over time  and this is something that we have also clearly stated.,0.11835194192826748,NEUTRAL
It is -- has always been our view. And this clearly will shave off some of the expected returns of some players. But the access to customers  the platform of the development  the management of the assets and the efficiency of the organization  so that means the competitiveness and the size and the focus of the organization will determine the capability of any player to deliver on the expected returns.,0.11202221969142556,NEUTRAL
The adoption of an integrated business model and a multi-technology integrated business model allows to better absorb external shocks to optimize the risk return profile. I think you will see that even more evidently  when you start to see and it is beginning to show the divergence between pure players and integrated companies.,0.09469512803480029,NEUTRAL
So we believe the market is getting this logic  is getting also the protective mix of activities that the group has. And therefore  it is not a surprise that we did not see the same trend in our share when compared to other peers or other players that have not the same risk profile.,-0.02546423301100731,NEUTRAL
Overall  I think the story is still very solid. There is a trend competitiveness in renewals. It s always been our view  and it s now showing maybe more clearly than before. And therefore  some say some companies might get a little bit penalized by that.,0.06749207992106676,MIXED
Monica Girardi,-0.0006111231341492385,NEUTRAL
Okay. We move to a completely different business  but again  a really popular question  open fiber. Francesco  can you share with us some update when the transaction with Macquarie is expected to be finalized  And what s the stake that you expect to sell ,-0.04686544090509415,NEUTRAL
Francesco Starace,0.00044685402826871723,NEUTRAL
The transaction is going to be finalized. It is going to be between     to     maximum  in the next few months or weeks and months  this is going to be basically completed. To where do we stand  The discussions are now being held between Macquarie  the buyer of our share and Cassa Depositi e Prestiti  CDP  the other shareholder  and the discussions are about the governance. So what kind of governance the two players want to have going forward.,0.021487520076334476,NEUTRAL
Let s say that this is not rocket science. It s a governance about -- a company that has one infrastructure as a mission. It is in one country  Italy  and the shareholders are    out of which one has a consolidating stake. So let s say  it s governance     for -- as far as this is concerned  and it will not take that much to be finalized. We expect  therefore  the transaction by -- to be certainly closed by year-end.,-0.16408792324364185,NEGATIVE
Of course  we will update you as soon as this is clear  as soon as the last steps are completed. Again  this is a very clear example of how much we can create value when we implement a stewardship model in this kind of infrastructure place.,0.2392811140161939,NEUTRAL

Just to preempt another question that will come up eventually  that is the change of government hasn t changed a little bit  the outlook of this deal to come through  No. We did not get any signal that this still is an item of discussion at all in the present situation at the present government. So there is no signals on that  okay  So that we don t get a question on this.,-0.27211124496534467,NEGATIVE
Monica Girardi,-0.0006111231341492385,NEUTRAL
Fair enough. So we moved to the simplification of Enel Am ricas. So merger of EGP and Enel Am ricas  once the PTO will be completed  what are the next steps you envisage for the perimeter of Am ricas  Will there be any disposals ,0.048626912059262395,NEUTRAL
Francesco Starace,0.00044685402826871723,NEUTRAL
I think as soon as we finished with the PTO  we will sit with the residual minority shareholders and define what are the key strategic options that Am ricas has to maximize value creation going forward  One of the many options is also to be more selective in terms of the geographies where we want to continue to operate in Latin America in the light of their growth perspective  their stability and the potential creation of value that we can pursue in different geographies.,0.05853652331279591,NEUTRAL
Based on this  we will decide having listened also  of course  to all the minority shareholders. And therefore  we will proceed to simplify maybe also the geographical positioning in the four countries that are today part of Enel Am ricas. I said four  but it s wrong. They are actually seven because there are three minor countries in Central America that are now part of the portfolio of the country. So there are seven countries.,-0.11726652178913355,NEUTRAL

Okay. We move to the CFO for another really popular question. Currencies were a major headwind in      and are still showing weakness.

Yes  we are. Sorry. For       yes  we -- it was the main headwind we had     billion of impact. So there is -- so we recovered the COVID impact  but we will leave a    billion impact on FX. First month of the year  some signs of weakness still present in FX currencies  with some signs of different win to move  mainly in Brazil  which headwinds had been more impacted by some things and not by the general scenario  It s too early to say because the first two months  vaccination in progress.,-0.207562695723027,NEUTRAL
So we think that we will have a clear view of the overall impact  looking at the second half of the year and not in the first two months of this year. A pure mark-to-market now may  so are applying      million       million impact that we think will not stay along the year. But on the other side  I said we have many party movements in our profit and loss  mainly the good results of our stewardship model that can -- so I d say it s not easy but can cover some headwinds if  at the end  we will have some impact from FX.,0.0020177606493234634,MIXED
Monica Girardi,-0.0006111231341492385,NEUTRAL
Okay. So I guess the bottom line is that no  the guidance is not at risk. Now we still -- another one on guidance  actually. Net debt is well below the guidance provided for the year. Will this improvement carry over to the            net debt figures ,0.026133544743061066,MIXED
Alberto De Paoli,0.0005298724718159065,NEUTRAL
Well  the general answer is no. So we think we have -- the trend of our debt is fully in line with what we have presented for the three years  plan. The main driver of changes in      is based on sort of the timing of the hybrid bond equity accounting because in our projections  we included only      million because we didn t include the concepts of solicitation that we launched at the end of      that occurred.,-0.13731955224648118,NEUTRAL
So -- but we had projecting these solicitation for     . So it s only the main part is a timing difference then we have some saving but not in the numbers that you see.

Monica Girardi,-0.0006111231341492385,NEUTRAL
Okay. Alberto  still with you on working capital dynamics  which are the main drivers of the strong improvement in working capital from the nine months  is the reduction fully associated with the reabsorption of the negative COVID effects ,0.05779510736465454,NEUTRAL
Alberto De Paoli,0.0005298724718159065,NEUTRAL
Well  yes. First of all  yes. So the vast majority is the absorption of COVID effect that we have shown in the first half. Well  I think a combination of two things  one  some new actions that we put in place to recover mainly  so moving to digital payment s a huge part of our customer base along the year. And this is one of the main part.,-0.0027854852378368378,NEUTRAL
And the second is that some regulators maybe so focused in Brazil that has -- was the more -- the most active in this. So they gave us some aids in financial aids. So the impact in Brazil accounted for almost      million and was -- so the main action to solve the financial problems of the Brazilian distributors that was related to the delay in payments for customers are caused by the lockdown and others. These two main things allow us to recover almost in full the impact of working capital for COVID.,0.03601199761033058,NEUTRAL

Alberto De Paoli,0.0005298724718159065,NEUTRAL
Okay. So first of all  as said  so the    billion impact of FX  so it s not directly connected to COVID  but so it s clearly related to this. Out of this impact  as said  we had a      million impact on EBITDA because of COVID.,-0.09222814626991749,NEUTRAL
As I said in the presentation       million are mainly related with the contraction volumes and      million related with other things  and the main are losses on the network front. So the time in which we can t act against frauds. So fraud  we had a huge increase in frauds  then another     million      million was a delay in the development.,-0.4574792811181396,NEGATIVE
But on the other side  we can have also -- we had also positive impact because we have a huge decrease in OpEx. I don t know  travel expenses and other kind of OpEx that was main related with the new situation for COVID.,0.2266954928636551,POSITIVE
When it comes to countries  I would say that Italy was resilient at all  so the impact is    with different moving parts that bring the country to these results. Iberia impacted the more  roughly      million  mainly because of this long position in the hedge contracts that -- so it s the one-off effect of the sharp contraction of demand.

When it comes to the business lines  the most impacted lines are the lines that work on volumes.

Monica Girardi,-0.0006111231341492385,NEUTRAL
Okay. Francesco  we go back to you on a -- with a question on renewables. So renewable addition came in at       megawatts but were impacted by COVID. Can you remind us what would have been the level of new capacity in absence of the pandemic  And what do you expect for      in terms of delivery  Is there any further risk from COVID you see now ,-0.12785784900188446,NEUTRAL
Francesco Starace,0.00044685402826871723,NEUTRAL
Yes. No. So let s see  the additional built that we missed to put into the      year is around     megawatts  as we said. So we would have been slightly below       megawatts without any COVID impact  if we have no COVID impact.,-0.12376563623547554,NEUTRAL
Now what happens during      is that  yes  this     megawatts are rolled into the      target. We expect to recover fully during     . And then  therefore  to go above the      -megawatt threshold quite substantially during the      year. So     year will not only recover the delay of       but also accelerate further compared to     .,-0.008908368647098541,NEUTRAL
Frankly  no  we don t see any residual risk  so COVID in term -- as far as installations are concerned. You might recall that I mentioned these facts at the beginning of the pandemic that we anticipated some slowdown on permitting because of public administrations around the world being confined at home or not really as effective or as productive.,-0.23069150373339653,NEGATIVE
If you can use this word  on the permitting phase  and therefore  some impact on further down the road. So far  we don t see an impact in    . We are assessing if there is anything on      so no impact at this point. We think this is over.,-0.39384907204657793,NEGATIVE
Monica Girardi,-0.0006111231341492385,NEUTRAL
Okay. Again with you  Francesco  you have shown meaningful progress in      on phasing out generation from coal. What is the status of discussion with governments in shutting down coal plants  especially in Italy ,-0.04868365079164505,NEUTRAL
Francesco Starace,0.00044685402826871723,NEUTRAL
So you know that we have a commitment to phase out coal. And during the CMD  we said     as the end date. And we are working basically with screed operators  governments  local communities in order to do this by then. This is -- let s face -- let s understand what we are talking about. We are talking about disconnecting plants from the networks  okay  So if you look at phasing-out action  this is already taking place in a spectacular way.,0.03069230169057846,NEUTRAL
We went down     on coal this year     . This will continue to go -- to come. So the production will be extremely marginal going forward  but the symbolic and substantial disconnection from the grid of an infrastructure requires an agreement from network operators that need to be  let s say  comfortable with the fact that if this capacity is withdrawn from the system  the system can withstand shocks of all kinds.,-0.18981913197785616,NEGATIVE
So where do we stand with this  We have an early shutdown during     . We got an early shutdown from Italy -- from Italian network operator and authorities to take out the first unit of the Brindisi power plant  which is now being dismantled  and to take up two out of four units of the Fusina power plant by       which is going on. So this is according to plan. That s okay. We have discussion in Spain with the phaseout of  indiscernible  following the decision of closing  which has been communicated and has been accepted.,-0.29291854705661535,NEGATIVE
The question today is basically  therefore  not a question of reducing production. It s basically going to stop way before       but rather making comfortable the operator -- network operators that s taking the plants off the grid  poses no risk to the stability of the grid itself  which is something that we are working at  and it s something that we are quite confident we can achieve by     . So we are in good track in this space. And we are ahead of the curve when you look at the actual production from the existing facilities.,0.12413355335593224,NEUTRAL
Monica Girardi,-0.0006111231341492385,NEUTRAL

Francesco Starace,0.00044685402826871723,NEUTRAL
So this is a little bit more in the future than people would think  but anyway. So yes  we have a commitment on the green hydrogen front  so on hydrogen produced by hydrolysis. And the commitment we have is to -- through the implementation of some projects  push the boundaries of this technology and drive the evolution of this technology in order to find out if the cost of the electrolyzers can drop a factor of six.,0.025834991596639156,NEUTRAL
So it can drop from        per kilowatt to about      per kilowatt. This is what it takes  coupled with the renewable energy costs. So today  we have already reached. This is what it takes to bring green hydrogen at par with the present hydrogen costs. Without that  failing that  this technology will never really pick up  if not for some niches of very specific applications. So our goal is to work with various partners in different countries. We have projects in Italy. We have projects in Spain. The largest one are in Spain.,0.24990771431475878,POSITIVE
And we have project in Chile  and we have projects in the U.S. to use these projects in order to push and get possibly a solution to this  cost issue on investment  cost issue on the electrolyzers and understand this technology fully. The next    years should be enough in order to establish whether this happens.,0.05351065145805478,NEUTRAL
And there are times when this happens  and there are times when it does not happen. And you might recall  for example  that TV panels have done this. Batteries are doing it. But solar -- thermal solar generation did not succeed. And there are examples of one and the other kind. So we are engaged in this kind of discovery trip.,-0.24809858575463295,NEGATIVE
Monica Girardi,-0.0006111231341492385,NEUTRAL
Really clear. So another one for you  I think  Francesco. Italy has highlighted the country we received more than      billion from the EU recovery fund. When should we expect project proposal for the use of these funds to start to come through ,0.252113476395607,POSITIVE
Francesco Starace,0.00044685402826871723,NEUTRAL
Let me answer also for the other three countries in Europe where we are present  which are Spain  Greece and Romania. So the deadline that a commission has set has -- as a latest possible date  the end of April. Some countries like Spain have already advanced their proposals. Some countries like Italy have not yet done the full homework.,-0.039301417768001556,NEUTRAL
But let s say that within April  all the initiatives will have to be presented to the European task force that manages this incredible task of understanding which projects fit and which projects do not fit the logic and the criteria of the EU. To do that  the European Union has eight weeks  so two months to respond with various feedbacks. And then the European Council needs to have an approval of four weeks. So we think that including a potential pre-financing of      member states could get the first money streams within       okay ,-0.019681842532008886,NEUTRAL
I m saying this because you need to have -- in order for this flow of money to really materialize  you need to have to establish the allocation procedures on a competitive basis in respecting all the guidelines on state aid that are important for private players like we are or you need to have regulatory framework changes in order for the same to happen on regulated concessionary businesses as we have also that cannot play on a competitive basis. So there are two parallel tracks that need to be established.,-0.07226452976465225,NEUTRAL
All in all  I think there are several areas where this can happen. Let me just give you a little bit of a rule of thumb. It s easier to accelerate the pace of project implementation and activity of something that is already moving -- that something that already has an entrant on its own. So in other words  if we have  as we do in many countries  a large flow of investment already in some businesses  it s easier to increase that and therefore be at the early part of the disbursement of these funds. It s less easy to jump-start something that does not exist.,0.1668148199096322,POSITIVE
Let s take the hydrogen things. They need to be designed. They need to be permitted  and therefore  they will be able to capture flows of money  sizable flows of money only probably a little later than networks  for example  or accelerated deployment of digital meters or infrastructure of this case. But because we are in both fields  we are optimally positioned to benefit from this flow of money in a uniform way across the different geographies. So we are very confident that this will be quite possible for us.,0.028716016560792923,NEUTRAL
Let s not forget the dimensions that European Unions are facing are looking for are totally in line with our strategy. So renewables  electrification  networks  digital content  they re exactly in line with our strategy. So we think we will benefit from this quite substantially.,0.09487333125434816,NEUTRAL

Alberto De Paoli,0.0005298724718159065,NEUTRAL
Okay. For the -- in the      impact  so we had an overall impact coming from Brazil of      million       million for FX impact and      million related with the COVID impact. When it comes with this      million  the three main items were roughly   terawatt of lower demand  that s worth around      million  the said increase in losses for around     million  and then we have the delay of new renewables projects for around     million.,-0.23812553472816944,NEGATIVE
And then we had another item that is related with the bad debt associated with the fees of downing of roughly     million. And these are the main headwinds in our LatAm activities are coming from Brazil. On the other side  for the ongoing discussion with the regulator  that I remember that is a discussion of the economical restore of the impacts because the financial  once they have been restored with the COVID -- the Quinta COVID agreement.,-0.0554691175930202,NEUTRAL

So a solution that now is on the table is to have a recourse of tax clean. So the taxes that are present in Brazil.

Alberto De Paoli,0.0005298724718159065,NEUTRAL
Well  so first of all  the cold spell in Texas affected our wind farms  as of -- for the majority of the players operating in the area. Main impact was due to the rising of blades.

But as of today  we see a maximum potential economic impact that at a net income level is set to be eligible  even if the PUCT actions filed are not successful  like we think that in some way  they will do.

It s clear that potential impact of rising inflation may be on bond yield  while we don t see no major issues on the issuance side  but also on the stop of that because almost     of our debt is at fixed rate or hedged.,0.011857274919748306,NEUTRAL
Monica Girardi,-0.0006111231341492385,NEUTRAL
Okay. Alberto  we are receiving lots of messages addressed to you about a clear statement around the guidance for       if you can confirm that you don t see any risk at the targets that we shared with the market back in November.,0.02793378010392189,NEUTRAL

Monica Girardi,-0.0006111231341492385,NEUTRAL
Okay. Perfect. Well  I think it s the byproduct  but let s open also the discussion around the dividend payment. Francesco  if you want to comment if you see any risk to the dividend payment for       Francesco  you are on mute ,0.34636670438339934,POSITIVE
Francesco Starace,0.00044685402826871723,NEUTRAL
No. We don t see any risk on dividend payments on the back of the guarantee we gave already in the Capital Market Day  on the back of our view  as we just said  that the guidance needs no change. And on the back that this year would probably be a little better than       where we did not change our dividend policy  so no  no change.,-0.13984768837690353,MIXED
Monica Girardi,-0.0006111231341492385,NEUTRAL
Okay. Now we move to a set of questions  and we hope to go through quickly around the business. The first one is for the CEO  and it s about the pipeline  which has increased enormously versus last November. If you can provide some color on the underlying dynamics of such a big step-up.,0.0584741048514843,NEUTRAL
Francesco Starace,0.00044685402826871723,NEUTRAL
I think we need to get used to this going forward because the ambition of the growth objectives that we have outlined for the decade as such that this gross pipeline needs to start now in order for this to be delivered three  five years down the road. So people should not look at the pipeline. And what we re doing in the same year because the pipeline is about three  five years down the road  and what we re doing in the year is what the pipeline was three  five years ago.,-0.2133003156632185,NEGATIVE
So the pipeline grew because our ambition are of growth and because there is space for growth. And there is an ongoing effort  which is not going to stop. This will continue. Today  we have a mature pipeline that went up       megawatts in this period. It s about in the few months  mostly concentrated in Europe  Africa and Oceania.,0.14040195383131504,NEUTRAL
The step-up of the early-stage pipeline includes projects in Spain  where the growth is now happening in a large space. U.S.A.  more than     is there  Latin America  and a little bit in the rest of the world. So this will continue. It looks a lot  but if you look at what we have in mind and the kind of growth that is available out there  it s -- I think it s just right.,0.14103482849895954,NEUTRAL
Monica Girardi,-0.0006111231341492385,NEUTRAL
Okay. Again  Francesco  I think this is for you. In light of the results of the Italian renewable auction  which is your view in terms of renewable development in Italy  what are your expectations in terms of price evolution ,0.15614021010696888,NEUTRAL
Francesco Starace,0.00044685402826871723,NEUTRAL
I think I have anticipated this trend about a year ago. You might recall that I have said Italy tracks Spain with  .  years delay because of the slow process of optimization and permitting that separates these two countries. Italy is a little bit -- it s quite slower in terms of permitting. So there is an inertia that needs to be bridged.,-0.12928813882172108,MIXED
And that is shown in the fact that tenders are not full. I mean  the capacity is not fully satisfied. And obviously  prices are higher. Will this continue  No. I think it will be gradually picking up with that delay that we had in mind that is showing now finally in its dimension. But prices will stay higher for the next probably    to    months. Yes.,-0.48013934562914073,NEGATIVE
Monica Girardi,-0.0006111231341492385,NEUTRAL
Okay. Again for you. Comment on the measures approved by the Mexican government  which is restricted -- restricting access to the wholesale market. Can you share any thought ,-0.08972834795713425,NEUTRAL
Francesco Starace,0.00044685402826871723,NEUTRAL
We think these measures are wrong. They are against the law. In fact  I think the judges in Mexico think the same  and they have ruled quite robustly against them. We hope that the governments understand that this is preventing a flow of investment in the country and damaging the trust of investors in the country itself. So we guess this will finally get to the right attention level.,-0.2257461603730917,NEGATIVE
I think the decree prevents free market competition. It promotes monopoly and also eventually compromises environmental targets of the Mexican government itself. So I think the supreme cart and the judges have already ruled against this decree on constitutional level. We are ready to go wherever it needs to be done in terms of iteration and rolling.,-0.10852857958525419,MIXED
But clearly  this marks a little bit of slowdown on the investment cycle in Mexico  which  by the way  for us  was basically idling  waiting for this to happen. So we re not particularly hit. I might recall that we have a joint venture in Mexico in which we have a minority stake already. So the impact is -- on the accounts  it s small. But I think it s a proof that if a country wants to inflict its damage on itself  it can. And I hope this ends quickly.,-0.1499401954934001,MIXED
Monica Girardi,-0.0006111231341492385,NEUTRAL
Okay. Alberto  we go back to the auctions  and we change a country though. Analysts are asking about the auction since Spain that have been awarded at a really low price. What is your view on the underlying economics  And if you think that the returns are sustainable at such a low price.,-0.11001503840088844,NEUTRAL
Alberto De Paoli,0.0005298724718159065,NEUTRAL
Well  I have already expressed in other times. So what we think about  so the very low price that we see at tenders. First of all  so the outcome price has to be assessed because every tender is seeking to have price that is very low  and then you have to look at other items that are eaten in the offer that may increase the price. That s the first for all the tenders in the world.,-0.06916378811001778,NEUTRAL
Second is it s clearly that the timing which a lot of developers is only this way to develop. It s clear the tenders will be very  very  very competitive. And because -- so everyone is seeking to have these PPAs to have a higher level of leverage coming from banks and reducing the level of equity.,-0.025502517819404602,NEUTRAL
And sometimes  so the -- with faith in the future that may -- so at the end of the PPA may say in the business plan that the next    years after the business plan will be the years that will set the clear return on projects. We don t think that is the case. We think that the prices in renewable will go down  so there is no future in which still in the second part of the useful life of plant  you will see prices that will be higher than today.,-0.22946157306432724,NEGATIVE
We think that with a spot price that is in the range of     offering    is a strange offer because at the end  you are losing     per megawatt hour in the year in which you have this difference. And you are also hoping that it will stay also for a longer time. And that we saw offers by far down versus the average levelized cost of energy that today is an average in the country in the case in Spain.,-0.21742998622357845,MIXED
Having said that  we participate in the tender  and we lose tender because we offer prices that are in line with our levelized cost of energy. But the real development that we see in countries in which we are integrated is not to tenders  but is developing capacity and integrating the capacity with the demand offered by our retail segment.,0.021951498463749886,NEUTRAL
Monica Girardi,-0.0006111231341492385,NEUTRAL
Okay. Again  for you  Alberto. Given the extreme weather events that can occur like Texas  how is the resource availability in       Could you please provide the sensitivity or resource availability for      ,-0.02219463139772415,NEUTRAL
Alberto De Paoli,0.0005298724718159065,NEUTRAL
Well  year started very well. In the past  we have mainly Europe have very high level of. And also Chile is recovering the very dry situation of the last year  while wind and solar resources are aligned with what s expected. So today  so we -- clearly  we do not foresee any impact coming from resource and ability  while -- so we are now looking at having some better results because of the result of the first two months are encouraging.,0.29245318099856377,POSITIVE
Monica Girardi,-0.0006111231341492385,NEUTRAL
Okay. There was a question for Francesco about the coal phaseout that we expect for     . But if I m not wrong  Francesco  you explained the road map quite clearly before. So I would jump this  while for Alberto  there is a question around the hedging level for      and       and if you -- if we see any impact from prices volatility ,-0.013876272365450859,NEUTRAL
Alberto De Paoli,0.0005298724718159065,NEUTRAL
Well  for the hedging for       we have already completed more or less the hedging activities. We are now at     for Italy      for Spain. And we have an edge price that is stable versus the previous year. While for       we stand at     for Italy and     in Spain.,0.06557237170636654,MIXED
Remember  that we -- our hedge is on an integrated position. So we cover at the same time  production and retail activities. So it s for everyone to look on how the integrated margin is covered. And as I said  so now we are working on integrated margins stable along the years.,0.02696195151656866,NEUTRAL
Monica Girardi,-0.0006111231341492385,NEUTRAL
Okay. We move to networks  Francesco. What is that in Italy  Here we go again. Will happen at the end of       with the current interest rate environment and low BTP bond spread  how can the regulator keep the current  .   WACC level included in your plan assumption ,-0.022344669327139854,NEUTRAL
Francesco Starace,0.00044685402826871723,NEUTRAL
Two good question  in fact. But we think from one side  there is this. On the other side  there is the fact that distribution companies in general network investment  is the first kick of the party of the recovery fund and the investment. So the regulator in general will be extremely careful not to discourage a very high level of investment in distribution networks required by the energy transition.,-0.04543835110962391,MIXED
I have to also recall that the regulator during the last regulatory negotiation indicated that they wanted to switch from RAB-based to a RAB Totex mix during this next  the one that will start now regulatory period. So we are quite positive that there would not be a drastic change. The first consultation document will be issued in May. The negotiation will start at the end of    .,-0.042136026779189706,NEUTRAL
So we think that we are not that concerned in the returns where we are more curious to see what is the mix of the two -- what this migration from RAB to Totex that they have in mind  how they want to carry that out  in the context of the big push that the government is now throwing into the network development and infrastructure development for the next electrification phase in Italy.,-0.040114437229931355,NEUTRAL
So we are widely optimistic that this -- the end results of  let s say  the equivalent of  .  WACC can be achieved perhaps with different tools.,0.07128736563026905,NEUTRAL
Monica Girardi,-0.0006111231341492385,NEUTRAL
Okay. We move to different type of question  really popular one again. We have heard -- and I think Francesco  it s naturally for you. We have heard you were looking into the acquisition of WPD in the UK.,0.13221219461411238,NEUTRAL
Can you explain the rationale of that type of transaction  How does it fit with your strategy  And I would add if we are interested -- if it means that we are interested into potential M A in Europe ,0.014034936670213938,NEUTRAL
Francesco Starace,0.00044685402826871723,NEUTRAL
We have not offered for WPD. And this is -- we did not present a bid. We looked into it because we  of course  are interested in distribution networks around the world in the EU  in particular. Let s say  UK was in the EU when we had this thing in our mind  but it doesn t matter. It is still a very important part of Europe.,-0.02142905816435814,NEUTRAL
When we looked at it  and we saw the way it was managed and also the way in which the regulator in the UK is looking at these kind of assets  we decided not to offer  which doesn t mean that we cannot do that in other opportunities in Europe or elsewhere and when they will come along. So this time  we passed because they were not -- it was not interesting enough. And by the way  we saw the UK as increasingly risky place to go.,-0.3680337807163596,NEGATIVE
Monica Girardi,-0.0006111231341492385,NEUTRAL
Okay. Considering the exposure dynamics in LatAm.,0.0039227239321917295,NEUTRAL

Francesco Starace,0.00044685402826871723,NEUTRAL
It looks like the winner is a UK company. So I think for them  the risk is different. The risk profile of the UK is a little bit more palatable than for a company that does not sit in the UK.,-0.12919726967811584,NEUTRAL
Monica Girardi,-0.0006111231341492385,NEUTRAL
Okay. Now considering the exposure -- and another question in relation to networks  but it s LatAm. So Alberto  I think  given its volumes  it s for you. So considering the exposure to volumes dynamic dynamics in LatAm and the impact recorded in       how is      so far  And what are your expectation for the year ,0.058637628331780434,NEUTRAL
Alberto De Paoli,0.0005298724718159065,NEUTRAL
Well  we saw first level of recovery of demands already in the second half of      and now also the first month of     . So our expectations is that energy demand in      will go back to      levels. Right now  for the numbers we have on February  we can say that we see a demand that is in line what with February last year. So the level of demand that was before the starting of the lockdown for COVID. So this is encouraging because we think that this trend is -- there are no other fell out of COVID without further lockdown is progressively recovering.,0.013839207589626312,NEUTRAL
Monica Girardi,-0.0006111231341492385,NEUTRAL
Okay. I think we move to retail now. Francesco  for you. It s a kind of a recurring  recurring question. The end of the regulated tariff in Italy has been postponed further. What s the impact -- what is the impact you see from this on your business plan ,-0.1404766351915896,NEUTRAL
Francesco Starace,0.00044685402826871723,NEUTRAL
This is  as you know  very well  those that follow this saga since now   years   .  years  you know very well that I have always maintained that every new government has this wildcard to postpone the tariff. And this  again  has happened. I think -- by the way  it happened with the old government before they left. So I mean  it s even more the cooler.,0.28614526614546776,POSITIVE
So I think this is not a surprise for anyone. I think it is not a big game changer. For us  we ve always factored in  in the next three years  somehow this thing  but we have always kept our strategy of gradually and inexorably  I would say  grow our customer base  getting customers out of the related tariffs while this regulated tariff was in place  and this is now continuing.,-0.27051908895373344,NEGATIVE
So I think it is mildly positive going -- looking at the track record that we have in this field  it is very stable. Looking at how the market looks  it is changing nothing in terms of competitive pressure. It is prolonging the actual situation  which for us  I would say  is a well-known territory in which we will continue to implement the strategy of growth that we have so far successfully pursued.,0.420651838183403,POSITIVE
So I see a very  very small impact in terms of economic returns  but a very stable continuity in the growth of our customer base.,0.14222468063235283,POSITIVE
Monica Girardi,-0.0006111231341492385,NEUTRAL
Okay. We move -- we stay in Italy  and we add Spain. Alberto  this question is for you. Analysts are asking if you can provide a little bit of granularity around power volumes sold to B B and B C customers for Italy and Spain in       of course.,0.0011375159956514835,NEUTRAL
Alberto De Paoli,0.0005298724718159065,NEUTRAL
Okay. So in Italy  power sold in      had been down overall by   . B B segment was down   . That it means roughly   terawatt hours. In B C was up by   .,-0.26046936959028244,NEGATIVE
That roughly is   terawatt hour more. In Iberia  volumes are down overall    . B B contraction was up    . We are talking about roughly   terawatt hours  with B C down   . Also here is less than   terawatt hour. Overall  the contraction of industrial activities is the main driver for the contraction. And now we see a progressive recovery.,0.024962134659290314,MIXED
Worth mentioning that the reduction in the B B segment is the -- as the less marginality in the overall portfolio of our selling  that s why -- so the increase in B C  with a higher level of marginality  covered almost entirely the reduction in marginality coming from B B. And the only impact  really impact that we had on retail in      was the long position  the temporary long position that was created by the sharp contraction in the B B demand following the lockdown.,-0.01664435863494873,NEUTRAL
Monica Girardi,-0.0006111231341492385,NEUTRAL
Okay. So you spent a few words on the margins  which I think is also answering another question associated with B B and B C for Italy and Spain. So we move to a question which asked the latest observation around demand in Italy and Spain. So have you seen recently any recovery  What are the residual risks associated with COVID ,-0.2125245020724833,NEUTRAL
Alberto De Paoli,0.0005298724718159065,NEUTRAL
Yes. So in the first two months  we know a big bump  but we are observing a little trend of recovery that started in the second half of last year with some stop and go along the second part of     . Today  we see the electricity demand is flat in Italy and with minus    in Spain. So this is a steady recovery of demand that we observed along the month.,0.014751140028238297,MIXED
Monica Girardi,-0.0006111231341492385,NEUTRAL
Okay. I think we are approaching the two last questions and are both for the CFO. One is on the hybrid. So we move to the financials. So you have   .  billion hybrid bonds still accounted as debt. Are you going to change the maturity to perpetual and accounting as equity from now onwards  Will all the hybrids be accounted as equity ,-0.04583251103758812,NEUTRAL
Alberto De Paoli,0.0005298724718159065,NEUTRAL
Well  so we have started the process last year  as you know  and so we are looking to continue to do so also in the next year. We will use  depending on the overall impact  consent solicitation like we did for the first time in the last year or so we will wait the refinancing time for other. So it will depend on the market condition. And so we will evaluate accordingly with the best approach. At the beginning of this month  I remember that we have just issued the new hybrids for   .   billion  and these new hybrids will be fully accounted as equity.,0.05191372591070831,NEUTRAL
Monica Girardi,-0.0006111231341492385,NEUTRAL
Okay. Last one  the expectation of a less favorable interest rate environment can change or accelerate the deployment of your financial strategy ,-0.06047125346958637,NEUTRAL
Alberto De Paoli,0.0005298724718159065,NEUTRAL
Well  we constantly monitor the evolution of economic and financial environment. To give you an example  we took for the hybrid bonds  a clear wind between  x of some tool bullets in the market. The window was very clear. And so we get a very  very low level of cost. So the hybrid we issued had the overall cost of  .  .,0.03488980233669281,NEUTRAL
I think the lowest level of cost for a hybrid bond. And so we will do it also looking forward. I think that a lot of windows will be ready to refinance the debt. And so I would say  so we will -- I think we will have another one year or one. Five years of level-playing fields to finance or refinance the debt  but we worked that way.,0.2129043098539114,NEUTRAL
So the final answer is  I think  that we don t have any kind of impact for the foreseeable future  but also tactically speaking  we are working on windows being ready to do something soon as the condition are so easy for us.,0.20504914969205856,POSITIVE

Thank you  Tom  and good morning  everyone. Thanks for joining us on our call today. Each quarter we include a brief overview of the company shown on slide   for new investors. Taking a look at the full year fiscal       which ended on October   st  our total revenue grew by double digit to approximately     million. Our three largest categories service and licenses  advanced technologies and generation represent diversified sources of recurring revenue under multiyear contracts with investment grade customers. Consistent with our strategy  in future quarters  we expect the work we have done to rebuild our business development and go-to-market capabilities  recruit and onboard strategic talent and reenter and build client relationships and target global markets to yield growth including product sales.,0.3493285831937101,POSITIVE
Consistent with our prior experience in certain markets  such as Korea  the largest fuel cell market in the world  select countries across Europe and other international markets  we expect some customers to choose to purchase our platform bundled with long-term service contracts that run coterminous with platforms like should our marketing efforts be successful. We are optimistic about the momentum behind the global energy transition that we expect to be enabled by distributed generation  distributed hydrogen  long duration hydrogen energy storage and carbon capture. At the top of the slide  we highlight many of our customers currently utilizing our multi featured fuel cell platforms. Many of these systems integrate combined heat and power capabilities  creating very high energy efficiency levels  while others installations form the backbone of micro grids enhancing resiliency and reliability and or utilize biofuel resulting in carbon neutral to carbon negative power.,0.10777491790940985,NEUTRAL
Our platforms also have the ability to leverage multiple fuel types  a feature many customers are interested in. In addition  our carbonate fuel cell platform has the ability to deliver hydrogen through our Trigen platform. And we re developing a new capability of running our carbon and fuel cell in reverse or an electrolysis mode through a process known as Reforming  Electrolysis and Purification or REP. We believe that the distributed nature of our hydrogen platform can enable the hydrogen economy in advance of the midstream infrastructure availability. FuelCell Energy offers diversification across fuel cell technologies that enable solutions across multiple applications or jobs that need to be done.,0.07263030482135946,NEUTRAL
Additionally  as I will cover later in my remarks  we continue to advance the commercialization of our solid oxide fuel cell platform to produce hydrogen through highly efficient electrolysis  long duration hydrogen based energy storage  and zero carbon hydrogen power generation. We believe that these technologies can provide the firm capacity required to support intermittent renewable technologies  such as wind and solar  by converting the off peak energy occasionally generated by renewables  or excess energy produced in excess of demand into hydrogen that is stored and later set back to the same FuelCell Energy fuel cell stack to produce zero carbon power. Recently  the world watch the disruption and loss of life in Texas that caused by unavailability of power. FuelCell Energy is committed to delivering base load power installation across our carbonate and solid oxide platforms that can and have demonstrated their ability to reduce the likelihood of similar events in the future. We stand ready to support customers around the world.,0.0356524313101545,NEUTRAL
Next  moving to slide    I want to highlight our commitment to our purpose of enabling the world to live a life empowered by clean energy. We believe that all people around the world will increasingly need reliable always on power. The electric grid continues to evolve  but grid reliability remains a critical issue. We believe that FuelCell Energy is uniquely positioned to meet the reliability challenges with our broad product portfolio that can also assist with decarbonization goals. We don t subscribe to the notion that decarbonization has to mean de-industrialization  or the developing countries around the world can t participate in industrialized society. This purpose drives our strategic focus and the work we do.,0.17904000682756305,NEUTRAL
Turning now to the quarter  I have three overarching messages. The first is that we are continuing to make progress against our   .   billion backlog. As we execute our powerhouse business strategy by working differently and thus adds another   .  megawatts to our generation portfolio. Subsequent to quarter end with the addition of our new  .  megawatt PPA for our second project in Derby  Connecticut  our backlog has increased to   .  megawatts. We have completed the majority of our scope of work on the  .  megawatt project at the US Navy base in Groton  Connecticut. The company is currently awaiting the interconnection and other safety related work to be completed prior to the commissioning and commercial operations.,0.043478222825797275,NEUTRAL
The interconnection agreement for this project is a four party agreement and has taken longer than originally estimated to complete. FuelCell Energy looks forward to fortifying the power infrastructure supporting base resiliency  and the US Federal Government s defense critical electrical infrastructure objectives. Additionally  construction activity has been substantially complete for a  .  megawatt project at the San Bernardino  California Wastewater Treatment facility that will utilize onside biofuel to produce carbon neutral power. We re working with the local utility on the interconnection process prior to commissioning and commencing commercial operation. I want to provide a more color on interconnection for those less familiar with the process. Essentially  prior to being able to operate in parallel with the utility grid network  a series of studies such as a feasibility  distant impact and distribution studies are required to be performed by the appropriate local utility for distribution level interconnects or in some cases by the regional transmission organization for larger or grid connected projects.,0.08282259898260236,NEUTRAL
Before distributed electrical generation equipment is approved for connection to or operation in parallel with the grid  which is a requirement for commercial operation. These studies assess the addition of the power generation platform and its impact on the existing utility power system  as well as identify any interconnection facilities or network upgrades needed for interconnecting the platform to the utility grid. The lead time for this process can vary depending on a variety of factors  including the utilities ability to prioritize the studies  the technical complexity of the project site  and infrastructure work required by the utility prior to interconnection. We proactively manage every aspect of the interconnection process within our scope and responsibility to obtain interconnection as quickly as possible  while ensuring compliance with all safety and reliability requirements.,0.002274719183333218,NEUTRAL
As noted in the case of Groton  this work is being managed by a third party. We have also commenced construction on   .  megawatts of projects  including the  .  megawatt Trigen hydrogen platform that will deliver carbon neutral electricity  green hydrogen and produce water to Toyota at the Port of Long Beach. We believe our Trigen hydrogen platform is the only platform in the world that produces hydrogen and usable water in a single distributed platform. In addition  we are advancing our utility scale deployments in Yaphank  Long Island  New York and Derby  Connecticut. We were able to resume manufacturing with necessary safety enhancements at our Torrington Connecticut manufacturing facility in June of     . And we have established a phased and return to work schedule for those employees that have been working from home through this month.,0.044795165144023485,NEUTRAL
We continue to evaluate our ability to operate in light of recent resurgence of COVID-   and the advisability of continuing operations based on federal  state and local jurisdiction requirements around the world  evolving data concerning the pandemic  the availability of vaccines  and the best interest of our employees  customers and shareholders. The second key message I want to highlight is the progress we ve made toward bolstering our financial foundation  strengthening our liquidity and creating an opportunity to reduce our cost of capital. As we have previously disclosed during the quarter  we completed an additional equity offering resulting in net proceeds to the company of approximately      million. And third  I want to reiterate our goal of strengthening our leadership and sustainability and environmental stewardship. Customers around the world are increasingly looking for authentic  onsite and sustainable decarbonize energy solutions to address climate challenges  enhance grid reliability  and enable them to continue to operate their businesses without intermittent disruptions. To meet the growing global need for clean decarbonized energy  FuelCell Energy remains focused on developing and deploying our product portfolio solutions for some of the largest global energy opportunities.,0.07510091224685311,NEUTRAL
A recent technology milestone has been the commencement of operation and testing of our prototype SOEC or Solid Oxide Electrolysis platform in Danbury  Connecticut.

Thank you  Jason. Let s begin by reviewing financial highlights for the quarter shown on slide  . In the first quarter of fiscal year       we delivered    .  million in total revenue  a    decline compared to the first quarter of fiscal year     . The primary driver of the decrease was that the first quarter of fiscal year      included    million of nonrecurring license revenues associated with our Joint Development Agreement or JDA with ExxonMobil Research and Engineering Company or EMRE related to carbon capture technology development.,0.2103987568989396,NEUTRAL
Looking at revenue drivers by category  Service and License revenues decreased     to   .  million from   .  million in the prior year period. Revenue recognized in the first quarter primarily includes revenue recorded for module replacements and routine maintenance activities. Whereas revenue recognized in the first quarter of fiscal year      included nonrecurring license revenues of    million associated with our JDA with EMRE and   .  million associated with routine monitoring and maintenance activities for projects under service agreements. Generation revenues decreased     to   .  million due to a temporary shutdown of several of the individual plants at the Bridgeport fuel cell project for scheduled module exchanges in the quarter. Advanced Technology contract revenues decrease    to   .  million from   .  million. Compared to the first quarter of fiscal year       Advanced Technology contract revenues recognized under the JDA with EMRE were approximately          higher during the first quarter of fiscal year       reflecting continued advancement of our joint research with EMRE on fuel cell carbon capture solutions during the quarter.,0.0008356445468962193,NEUTRAL
The increased revenues under the JDA were offset by          of less revenue recognized under government contracts in the first quarter of fiscal year      compared to the first fiscal quarter of fiscal year     . Gross loss for the first quarter of fiscal year      total   .  million compared to a gross profit of   .  million in the prior year quarter. Results for the quarter of fiscal year      reflected no license revenues under the JDA during the quarter  as well as a temporary shutdown of several of the individual plants at the Bridgeport fuel cell project for module exchanges during the quarter and higher manufacturing variances and service related costs compared to the prior year period.,-0.19818464037962258,NEUTRAL
Operating expenses for the first quarter of fiscal year      increased to    .  million from   .  million in the first quarter of fiscal year     . Administrative and selling expenses in the first quarter of fiscal      included additional stock based compensation expense of          tied to grants made in       and an increase in the value of the deferred director compensation liability due to the increase in the company s share price. The first quarter of fiscal year      included a legal settlement of   .  million  which was recorded as an offset to administrative and selling expenses.,-0.001220543636009097,NEUTRAL

Net loss for the quarter totaled     million  compared to a net loss of    .  million in the first quarter of fiscal year     . Net loss attributable to common stockholders for the quarter totaled    .  million or   .   per basic and diluted share  compared to a net loss attributable to common stockholders of    .  million or   .   per basic and diluted share in the comparable prior year period.,-0.19285681354813278,NEUTRAL
The lower net loss per common share  despite a higher net loss attributable to common stockholders is due to the higher weighted average shares outstanding from share issuances since January         . The net loss per share in the first quarter of fiscal year      includes the change in fair value liability associated with the warrants issued to lenders under our now extinguished credit agreement with Orion Energy Partners of     million  accounting for approximately a   .   per share impact on the reported net loss per share  compared to    .  million or   .   per share in the comparable prior year period. The net loss per share attributable common shareholders in the quarter ended January          also included a loss on the extinguishment of debt and the loss and extinguishment of preferred stock obligation of subsidiary together totaling    .  million  or a   .   per share impact on the reported net loss per share.,-0.14289746340364218,NEUTRAL
Adjusted EBITDA totaled negative   .  million in the first quarter of fiscal year      compared to adjusted EBITDA of negative          in the first quarter of fiscal year     . Please see the discussion of non-GAAP financial measures including adjusted EBITDA in the appendix of our earnings release. Prior to leaving the slide  I would know that the pictures on the right showcase the progress that we ve made on the  .  megawatt platform at the Navy sub base in Groton  Connecticut.,-0.014914141036570072,NEUTRAL
Next  please turn to slide   for additional detail on financial performance and our backlog. The chart on the left hand side of the slide graphically displays the numbers I walked through for the first quarters of fiscal years      and     . Looking at the right side of the slide  we finished the quarter with backlog of approximately   .   billion  a decrease of    subsequent to the end of the quarter  the company entered into a    year Power Purchase Agreement or PPA with a Lime United Illuminating for a  .  megawatt project in Derby  Connecticut  awarded as part of the competitively bid state sponsored shared clean energy facility program. This platform will supply  .  megawatts of clean base load power to the Connecticut electric grid  enhancing resilience and is our second project located in Derby.,0.015508540614973754,NEUTRAL

Thanks Mike. As mentioned previously  we are near completion of two new power platforms one at the US Navy base in Groton  Connecticut  and one zero carbon biofuel platforms at the wastewater treatment facility in San Bernardino  California. Our SureSource       and SureSource       power platforms are the only fuel cell systems certified to carbon emission standards under the distributed generation certification program for operations with onsite bio gas. We also began early stage construction of   .  megawatts of projects including the Toyota Hydrogen project at the Port of Long Beach  and utility scale projects in Yaphank on Long Island in New York and Derby  Connecticut.,0.14648700691759586,NEUTRAL

Turning to slide     I want to take a moment to highlight the strong resiliency characteristics of our shore source platform. As I mentioned earlier  recent headlines in Texas surrounding extreme weather  as well as continued challenges for grid reliability in markets such as California  or the extreme freeze in Greece in the UK in February  continue to expose the inherent challenges of a long distance transmission based grid. In cities across America  governments and utilities alike are hopeful any infrastructure package contemplated by Congress in the new administration will include funding to upgrade today s grid with reliable distributed megawatt scale power platforms. Our platforms not only run   x x    but have demonstrated their performance stability during some of nature s more extreme conditions. Highlighted on the chart to the left are numerous examples where our shore source platforms operated seamlessly and prolonged instances of extreme temperatures providing universities  industry credible resources and the broader utility grid with reliable power ,0.033095638267695904,NEUTRAL
On the right is an example of one of these installations  a shore source       located on the campus of the University of California  San Diego  as part of a micro grid solution  it helps provide energy security to more than        students on its approximate       acre campus. And beyond power  the University uses the thermal attributes of our platform with a heat exchanger being used to drive absorption chiller to provide cold water to the campus. This installation along with our micro grids installed at the jail in Santa Rita California  are highlighted by the magazine micro grid knowledge as being two World Class examples of micro grids that deliver on their promise of always on power  having continued to provide power during public safety  power shut offs in their respective areas.,0.07402701489627361,NEUTRAL
On slide     I want to again remind everyone of the four major market opportunities that FuelCell Energy is pursuing. Distributed generation  distributed hydrogen and long duration storage  and carbon capture. We believe that each of these has a very large total addressable market opportunity for which we are working to position the company to benefit. We continue to advance research and development of our carbonate fuel cell platforms efficiency  capturing carbon from an external source  while also producing power. Our proprietary carbon capture solution is the only solution that we know of that captures carbon from an external source and produces power rather than consuming it  and is also capable of producing hydrogen for distributed applications. We also can directly capture carbon from our own shore source power platform for carbon utilization and or sequestration.,0.16313899052329361,NEUTRAL
I also want to take this opportunity to spend more time on our hydrogen focus  including technology in the process of being tested  and advanced for commercialization.,-0.02102983370423317,NEUTRAL
So turning to slide     you will see a visual illustration of how FuelCell Energy will deliver hydrogen across three of our platforms. Our carbonate platform  featured on the right side of this line allows us to deliver hydrogen through our Trigen hydrogen platform. The first half of the word Trigen is important because the platform delivers three value streams to our customers. First  it delivers power. Second  it produces hydrogen  and third  it actually produces water while delivering hydrogen. Adding more value in areas where water for electrolysis is at a premium  which as previously stated  we believe makes it the only platform in the world that produces water and hydrogen.,0.15938514075241983,NEUTRAL
The Trigen platform can deliver green  blue and grey hydrogen. We re in the process of building the first commercial installation of this platform for Toyota at the Port of Long Beach today. When the coproduction of power is not required  our carbonate platform is being developed to produce green  blue or grey hydrogen through a reformer electrolyzer purifier process  RREP. Our solid oxide technology pictured here on the left side of this slide  which we are advancing to commercialization is designed to produce green  blue and grey hydrogen through highly efficient  high temperature electrolysis. In addition to our solid oxide fuel cell being designed to be highly efficient  operating at a high temperature  and having the ability to leverage waste to achieve even higher efficiency  it is designed to operate in reverse mode.,0.08084386968403123,NEUTRAL
The same platform stack used to convert electricity and water into hydrogen is reversible solid oxide mode will produce zero carbon power using the stored hydrogen. So one might ask why three platforms  The answer is simple. Customers want to accomplish different objectives and need to get different jobs done. Each location will have a unique pricing environment for fuel and electricity. In markets with higher power prices  our Trigen platform might be the best solution if you can sell the electricity into the grid at higher prices  which reduces the cost of the produced hydrogen  or perhaps local water is in scarce supply or is at a premium.,0.05080999433994293,NEUTRAL
We expect our developing REP platform to work well across various fuel and electric price environments and in environments where selling power to the grid is not an option. And it should be uniquely situated to carbon capture applications to produce blue hydrogen. With our solid oxide platforms high efficiency  design and expectation to leverage waste  it is expected to be well suited for low energy price environments and environments with high penetration of intermittent renewable energy resources. The breadth and depth of our developing technology portfolio positioned FuelCell Energy to deliver distributed hydrogen across several environments around the world. The flexibility we expect to provide around distributed platform  source and price of hydrogen will enable us to add value in almost all energy segments globally.,0.04579784185625613,NEUTRAL
The versatility of our developing platform configurations allow FuelCell Energy to serve transportation  industrial  natural gas decarbonization and substitution  repowering existing power infrastructure  and serving as a stationary power generation source and other processes not suited for electrification.,0.041673606508993544,NEUTRAL
Slide    provides a more detailed overview of our solid oxide platform. The prototype unit pictured here is a system currently operating in our Danbury Connecticut headquarters for testing of various platform design elements. This year  we will build a larger version of this solid oxide electrolysis fuel cell for delivery to the Idaho National Labs under a cooperative funding agreement with the US Department of Energy. The deal we project will incorporate a multi stack electrolysis system utilizing our solid oxide technology. The system will also be equipped with an option to receive thermal energy  thus expected to increase the electrolysis electrical efficiency from about     to approximately     . Following the design  manufacture and testing of the system at FuelCell Energy facilities  the electrolysis system will be delivered to Idaho National Laboratories  where it will undergo rigorous testing to confirm the electrical efficiency as well as the ability to utilize nuclear power plant waste to obtain higher efficiencies of up to     .,0.01826654356045765,NEUTRAL
This project represents a key step in FuelCell Energy s path to commercialize our high temperature  high efficiency solid oxide electrolysis technology. The multi stack module that forms the core of the system is a modular building block easily scalable for larger systems  we believe up to gigawatt scale.,0.06260484865924809,NEUTRAL
On slide     next I want to briefly review our powerhouse business strategy  which is based on the three core pillars of transform strengthening grow. When we introduced the powerhouse business strategy  we provided our plan to reposition FuelCell Energy to capitalize on the energy transition. The powerhouse business strategy serves as the guideposts for the turnaround we are architecting at FuelCell Energy. Like with most turnarounds  it takes time  we are approximately    months in our journey  and we are pleased with our progress today. The first phase of our plan was to transform the company to build a durable financial foundation and enhanced financial results. We have taken a number of important steps to strengthen the balance sheet  allowing us to finance completion of new projects and lower cost of capital.,0.10671587061369792,NEUTRAL
Currently  we are focused on strengthening stage of our strategy by driving operational excellence throughout the business and making capital investment decisions that further enhance our performance and advanced product commercialization. And our third pillar to fully deliver on the powerhouse business strategy we outlined is achieving growth over the long term by seeking to penetrate markets and customer segments where our technology platforms can be the preferred solution. Our production operations are well positioned for further capacity expansion  and will generate operating leverage as we ramp our production rate in support of future business growth. And support of our growth goal to achieve geographic market expansion including Europe  FuelCell Energy has announced it is joined Hydrogen Europe  the leading European Association representing the interest of the hydrogen and FuelCell Energy and its stakeholders reinforcing our commitment to the European market and providing a platform for European customers to better understand the value of our broad platform portfolio.,0.0508020789566217,NEUTRAL

Turning to slide     we will continue to work toward our long-term targets and goals that we established with the launch of our powerhouse business strategy looking ahead to fiscal year     . Reaching these targets to require successfully executing against our approximately    megawatt project backlog  and advancing commercial operations for each of those projects  which are expected to deliver recurring revenue through power generation and long-term service agreements. As I have explained in today s presentation  we are pursuing commercialization of our advanced technologies around REP in solid oxide hydrogen  and extending our carbon capture platform for solutions for capturing carbon from external sources  and internally from the fuel cell  each of which offers potential growth opportunities for our company.,0.04306511550385039,NEUTRAL
I will conclude my remarks today by reviewing key investment highlights for FuelCell Energy on slide   . We have executed several strategic actions that strengthen our balance sheet by repaying debt  enhancing liquidity and reducing our cost of borrowing  which we believe positions the company to execute on our growth strategy. We have a strong multi discipline team across our company that is focused on taking care of our customers achieving financial milestones  executing on our backlog  winning new business globally  advancing commercialization of our differentiated platform solutions  driving down the total cost of customer ownership  and continually building upon our operational excellence  while adhering to our core purpose.,0.05242262918909546,NEUTRAL

We re working to implement our powerhouse strategy to strengthen our business  maximize operational efficiencies and position us for long-term growth. We appreciate many of you who track our progress and look for mile markers that illuminate the progress we re making toward the achievement of our powerhouse business strategy. As I previously stated  we re just    months into our power hour strategy  and we believe we are on track. The breadth of our portfolio and the ability to apply our technology against a wider set of applications provides FuelCell Energy with greater optionality to shift focus towards    of our four energy transition focus areas based on the pace of market adoption  thus increasing diversification.,0.19136384155717678,NEUTRAL

Good morning  guys. I was wondering if you could flesh out a little bit more detail on the solid oxide electrolysis opportunity that you re testing and Danbury  I wasn t sure what the next steps are  and then how we think about the timeline to commercialization. And when you can start participating in REPs for that -- fully recognized  there are some incremental steps that need to be taken from here  but I was just wondering if we could sort of book in that and how long it will take.,0.15185924246907234,NEUTRAL

Hey  Jeff  great  good to have you on the call today and thanks for joining. Great question. Maybe I ll start and then I ll ask Tony Leo  our Chief Technology Officer to also chime in. So with this test we will lead to the next phase of actually executing the test with INL  will be the next phase of our process to get to commercialization. But as we think about the opportunity to your question of participate in REPs  given where we are and where some of these REPs or at least projects that people are talking about are kind of longer dated projects  we will participate in some of those opportunities if those timelines fit our internal projections about when our product will be commercial. But Tony  if you have anything else to add there for the phases ,0.23763787653297186,POSITIVE
TonyLeo,0.0026207835908280686,NEUTRAL
No. I ll just add the phases. The test we re doing now is with a single stack and sub scale system. And it s  we re developing the basic operational approaches that we ll be building into the logic of the multi stack system that we re building for INL later this year. So the stepwise process and we re happy with where we are right now.,0.3365228744223714,POSITIVE

Laurence  good morning. How are you  Thanks for joining the call this morning. If bidding activity  if you mean by that the amount of activity we re participating in terms of proposals or submitting proposals or responding REPs  I would say over the last  six months  it has increased fairly significantly for us. I mean  the sales cycle generally  given our megawatt class platforms generally take between    to    months as a sales cycle. But we ve seen  a lot of increase activity not only here domestically  but in the international markets that we re focused on. And so we re  as I think about it  and look at the pipeline and as we go through our phases in the pipeline from engaging a customer  ultimately to submitting a proposal. I think we re making a lot of progress there. And I feel good about the pipeline. And I feel good about the number of opportunities we have in the proposal phase.,0.21049981098622084,NEUTRAL
With respect to the number of projects that we could pursue  we -- if you think about what we do in terms of our carbonate platform  as we talked about  and maybe Mike Lisowski speak to a little bit in terms of how we re ramping our manufacturing capacity to meet the demand that we see. But the things that we re doing in regards to some of our European opportunities  we have our facility in Germany  which also gives us some capacity. And then the work that we re doing on solid oxide  that work is done between our facility in Calgary and our facility here in Danbury  so those projects aren t really competing against our capabilities to produce our carbonate platform and meet the opportunities that we ve responded to from an REP or proposal standpoint.

Thanks so much  guys. And well done on getting the balance sheet restructured. It sounds like you ve got a number of important technology programs underway.

Yes  Colin  good morning. Thank you. I ll ask Mike bishop to comment on that with respect to the increased capital that we re putting toward R D to support commercialization of these technologies. And from a  I ll just maybe speak to the skill set  and maybe Tony could add to as well. We feel really good about the technical resources we have on our team across engineering to support our R D efforts.

Yes. Good morning  Colin. Thanks for joining the call. So what we put out there when we put our   -K out was  we do expect to see higher on the OpEx side  we do expect to see higher R D spending around distributed hydrogen  hydrogen and long duration hydrogen storage. Last year  we reported about   .  million of R D expense. We re forecasting between     million to     million of R D expense from a CapEx perspective this year and adding manufacturing equipment and lab equipment were forecasted to be in the range of    million to     million of CapEx.,0.1587838064879179,NEUTRAL

Hi  yes. Question follows up so I guess my question  if I look at the maybe this is a Tony or Jason question. So if I look at the Trigen in adding the capture  how should we think about this in terms of reduction of efficiency by adding that additional capture methodology in that to go from grey to blue ,0.02972269686870277,NEUTRAL
JasonFew,0.0008941671694628894,NEUTRAL
So if you think about Trigen  if you count the energy value that hydrogen re-produces our efficiency actually goes up. It s quite high. Now if you add  and of course  for our Long Beach project  we re using directed bio gas. So that s zero carbon to begin with. If you re using natural gas and add carbon capture  you will probably -- you ll obviously you ll have to power that carbon capture equipment to some extent. So our  .  megawatt system in Trigen mode is  .  megawatts  you would probably go down to something like  .  with carbon capture.,-0.08721035346388817,NEUTRAL

Great. And just as a follow up on operationally  I guess  I m assuming that there s a point in terms of showing the progress and highlighting the Groton sub base  which seems like it s progressing nicely. So congrats on that. I guess I just want to understand the conversion from backlog into the recognition of those revenues and kind of that switch into the portfolio. So maybe if you could just  and maybe I missed it  but if you could articulate time expectations in terms of what needs to occur for completion and rev rec on that project. That would be helpful.

So maybe I ll start and then Mike Lisowski  Mike Bishop can chime in  just in terms of where we are in the process. Like I indicated in my remarks  we are materially complete with our portion of the work though with exception of getting the interconnection done and some other safety work that has to happen. So we haven t given an exact date simply because the interconnection agreement  like I indicated  is being managed by a third party. But maybe I ll ask Mike Lisowski to speak to that a little bit. But then from the point of getting interconnect and us going COD  is when we would start to generate revenue from that asset for the company.

Yes  Jed  thank you for your question  just to provide a little bit more color around the project. Yes  despite some challenges  I m really proud of the team and all the progress that s been realized in reaching our current advanced stage of project execution at the Groton site. As Jason has mentioned  all of the sites civil construction has been completed  all of the required equipment and materials have been fabricated and delivered to the site. All the mechanical assembly construction is complete at this point with the majority of the electrical installation completed as well. Right now we re in the process of discrete equipment checkout and safety related work as part of the commissioning process. And once we complete that plant commissioning process  we ll be well positioned to export power once interconnect is executed and finalized. And as Jason mentioned  that s the point at which it would convert into revenue generating assets.,0.4177699814608786,POSITIVE
MikeBishop,0.0002449913590680808,NEUTRAL
And Jed  this is Mike Bishop. I ll add one more point on the revenue side. And as I tried to highlight in my comments  our generation portfolio is the biggest portion of our revenue backlog. It s about   .  billion. Today  we have operating about    megawatts of operating assets and as we said in our remarks  we re in the process of building out another    plus megawatts of assets. So if you think about that operating portfolio  last year  we generated about     million of annualized revenue. Well  we re more than doubling the operating portfolio here over the next period of time as these projects  come online  so they ll begin to make meaningful contributions to increasing our generation revenue as they come online.,0.045462237438187,NEUTRAL

Hey  good morning. I was thinking back to the Exxon JV. And Exxon in their Investor Day a couple of weeks ago talked a good bit about how central carbon capture was to their various green initiatives. And I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit more about in the event there  there are new technologies that you aren t directly involved in introducing to the JV and for instance  on their call  they mentioned some progress with material technology as far as carbon capture from a gas stream. And I just wonder are those sorts of things do you have some access to those or is there some provision in your agreement where you would be able to get access to other things that they in the course of the JV ,-0.08528801798820496,NEUTRAL
JasonFew,0.0008941671694628894,NEUTRAL
Yes. So good morning. Let me try to start that. And then I ll ask Tony  maybe to chime in. So as a company  we are an as the joint development agreement to that we have in place with Exxon is very focused on our carbonate fuel cell technology. And what s compelling about the carbonate fuel cell technology are some of the things I mentioned in my comments that it s the only platform that we re aware of  that has the ability to capture carbon from an external source  produce more power at the same time  and deliver hydrogen from that same platform. That is the focus of our work with Exxon  and we believe that those differentiating attributes creates a very compelling proposition for Exxon and for carbon capture overall. And Exxon has a research organization inside their company  and they look at various technologies  but we re very focused on optimizing our carbonate technology to deliver against that.,0.24149548541754484,POSITIVE
And look  we also support the notion that in order to achieve the global sustainability goals  right  carbon capture has to be a part of that. And that the goal of reducing carbon or overall climate sustainability goals  should not be deindustrialization. And if deindustrialization is not one of the goals  which I don t think it is  then that means carbon capture has to be an important part of the solution. In addition to doing things like fuel substitution  like Hydrogen for example. And so we think we re well positioned to participate in all of those. And then Tony  I don t know if you have any additional comment relative to other technologies that Exxon is working on but that would not relate to us.,0.06498865876346827,NEUTRAL
TonyLeo,0.0026207835908280686,NEUTRAL
Yes  I mean  they re  for example  they re looking at direct air capture that is a carbon capture approach that is trying to solve a different problem than the problem of capturing co  from the fuel gas or boilers or power plants. So they ve got a comprehensive approach  a lot of the stuff they re doing has no bearing on us whatsoever. And as Jason said  we re very focused on our particular approach to carbon capture  which Exxon obviously  are interested in.,0.2816883511841297,POSITIVE
JasonFew,0.0008941671694628894,NEUTRAL
And I would just say if you look at other technologies  for example  just take direct air capture  right  Again  one of the significant differences we have versus direct air capture  direct air capture requires a lot of power to operate that technology  whereas we re additive to the power as opposed to being a parasitic on the power output.,-0.03955669607967138,NEUTRAL

MikeBishop,0.0002449913590680808,NEUTRAL
Sure. Good morning  Aaron. Yes  so maybe I ll take the last one first so the company has talked over the last several years about evolving the module life from five years to seven years. So any module exchange that we now do in the fleet has a seven year life and obviously extending stack life is a key tenet of our R D activities. Specific to the generation portfolio and what I mentioned on Bridgeport  Bridgeport is a    megawatt projects multiple plants at Bridgeport. So over the last couple of quarters  we have been doing module exchanges there with the goal of obviously extending life  as I just mentioned  but also increasing output. You would expect as we go through these to see higher revenue coming from that project. Specific to EBITDA  we have said externally that we do target EBITDA margins from our overall generation portfolio in the     range.,0.09772375971078873,NEUTRAL

Thank you  Fred and good afternoon everybody. Q  was a strong quarter of growth for FedEx. Despite challenging circumstances  the team performed exceptionally well through the biggest peak season in our company s history. This included delivering nearly  .  billion holiday packages  transporting the first shipment of COVID-   vaccines here in the US  and increasing collaboration across operating companies.,0.48473933279456105,POSITIVE
Our results speak for themselves. In December  we achieved the highest monthly totals in our company s history in both revenue and operating profit. Results in December were different than previous years. We better maximized our available capacity  and as Brie will cover in a moment  better aligned prices to incremental costs. Peak      was unlike any peak experience before and sets a new standard for future peak seasons.,0.20553848729468882,NEUTRAL

I m very proud of the team for managing through this very challenging situation.,0.36638306151144207,POSITIVE

Number one  we saw a meaningful improvement in last mile efficiency as service providers improve their stops per hour     year-over-year in Q . Number two  the average cost per stop decreased by     year-over-year.

Thank you  Brie  and good afternoon  everyone. FedEx delivered significantly improved financial results during the quarter  as we met the challenges of rising demand and limited capacity during our peak season and overcame severe winter weather in February.,0.48826618219027296,POSITIVE
Adjusted operating profit increased       and adjusted operating margin increased     basis points  primarily due to strong volume growth in U.S. domestic residential package  a     increase in FedEx international priority package volume  led by Asia and Europe  and solid execution of our revenue management strategies in the face of increasing demand across all our transportation segments.,0.03393403941299766,NEUTRAL
These gains were partially offset by four noteworthy factors. First  higher variable incentive compensation expense of      million  including a      million special bonus for global frontline team members at FedEx Express  second  lower revenues and higher costs due to significant weather events that reduced operating income by an estimated      million  third  the estimated impact of having one fewer operating week day  which was approximately      million  and lastly  consolidated direct COVID-  -related cost of approximately     million  which does not capture the many accommodations we continue to make across all our operations for the safety of our employees and to comply with various regulations and guidelines.,-0.14925418235361576,NEUTRAL

The snow amounts in Memphis had not been seen in over    years prior to the founding of FedEx and when coupled with a record time nine consecutive days below freezing  had a significant impact on our operations  as Fred and Raj mentioned. Our Indianapolis and North Texas Express hubs were impacted as well. Demand was deferred as significant portions of the US population were impacted by the various weather events.,-0.05134470947086811,NEUTRAL
Of the      million estimated impact       million was at Express      million at Ground  and     million at Freight. Despite that  the Express segment reported adjusted operating profit of      million with an adjusted operating margin of  .    up     basis points  driven by significant volume growth in both international export and US domestic package  as well as higher international priority yields.,0.015748907811939716,NEUTRAL

FedEx Ground had an exceptional peak and third quarter  growing operating margin     basis points over the prior year to  .  .

As Raj and Brie highlighted  our commercial and operational initiatives are yielding and will continue to yield profitable growth at Ground  as we capitalize on the e-commerce opportunity.,0.09068248822586611,NEUTRAL
Turning to FedEx Freight  operating income increased    despite the impact of increased variable compensation and the weather.

Freight also provided critical peak season operational support to both Ground and Express.,0.29907829832518473,POSITIVE

In addition  Express maintenance costs will be higher year-over-year in the fourth quarter as we execute on our flexible air fleet strategy. Just over a year ago  we shared with you plans to temporarily park the equivalent of seven MD-  s. Given the increased demand  we are efficiently adding needed capacity for our customers by investing in maintenance expense to utilize aircraft from temporary storage. As of now  we plan to have no temporarily parked MD-  s prior to next peak season.

While we have not finalized our FY      plans  capital spending will increase  as we invest in capacity and proceed with investments in replacement capital previously deferred.

Maybe you could talk about the   Brie  the return of B B on the Express side  same thing that you were just talking on Ground. Maybe you were talking about pricing starting to disappear in    months.

Brie Carere,0.012498823925852776,NEUTRAL
Hi  Ken. It s Brie. I ll start with the pricing and the yield element and then turn it back over to Don and Mike. From a yield perspective and from a B B  as we mentioned  as of January  here in the United States our B B volume was back to pre-COVID level. The mix within the B B wasn t what historically we have seen. It was obviously heavy healthcare  heavy retail  heavy tech. We have not seen it fully come back in automotive and industrial. So we think that  there s some upside there.,-0.10405470803380013,NEUTRAL
When you look at the B B volume outside of the United States  at a whole holistic level  we re back  but Europe is not. So we see there still opportunity intra-Europe and intercontinental outbound from Europe. The European team has done a phenomenal job of shoring up volume  but it is B C volume that they ve shored up that gap with. So I still think that there is some B B upside coming out of Europe still.,0.057810183614492416,MIXED
From a yield perspective  we re feeling pretty confident in our yields throughout this calendar year from an International Express as well as a Domestic Express. There is pressure on the yield from a weight perspective  because the e-commerce mix will continue to increase outside of the United States at Express.

We know the spread between the FedEx Ground economy and our FedEx Ground home delivery product  that yield spread  historically  has been too wide.,-0.10840108431875706,NEUTRAL
So  we are very focused on prioritizing capacity at the higher-yielding home delivery product. And so you re going to see two things happen. You re going to see us give more capacity to home delivery at the higher yield and you re going to see us increase the yield throughout this calendar year  both through peak surcharges as well as through GRI strategies  and quite frankly  just contractual discussion. So  that s really our focus is closing that gap  prioritizing capacity for home delivery and making sure we ve got capacity for our small and medium customers.,0.051524576963856816,NEUTRAL

Great. Good afternoon and thanks for taking my questions. So  Mike  I guess  maybe this one is for you. When I think about the fourth quarter implied guidance  historically  you see a fairly significant ramp in earnings from the third quarter to the fourth quarter. And when you normalize for the weather and the lower tax rate  your guidance -- implied guidance is for maybe a     increase in earnings from third quarter to fourth quarter  yypically  it s     to    .,0.3364117294549942,POSITIVE
So  I m just curious if maybe if you can walk us through some of the puts and takes there  Is it a factor of just the broader economy  Is some uncertainty there  Just some conservatism in general. Just can you help us think through the implied fourth quarter guidance and why you wouldn t see more of a normal seasonal ramp there  Thank you.,0.0402752049267292,NEUTRAL
Mike Lenz,0.003797184966970235,NEUTRAL
Jack  I m not going to get into de-comping all of the puts and takes that come into seasonality. I guess I would refer back to when I mentioned an effective tax rate for the year of     to      that implies a higher tax rate in Q  than our -- typically  you can rule a thumb for a full year.,-0.17700307816267014,NEGATIVE

Question  when you think beyond the fiscal fourth quarter of this year and into the next fiscal year  you start getting to some difference in tougher volume comps  especially in the Ground.

Brandon  you broke up a little bit  but if I understand asking about one of the CapEx references. So as we said  volume grew     at Ground.

Also  if you look at our -- when you get the chance to look at the stat book in terms of the maintenance CapEx  you can see that our facilities and vehicles  we deferred a lot of that this year.

Yes  good afternoon. Let s see. I wanted to   I think one of the questions that seems to come up is concern about potential to have some of that strength in international rates that s beneficial for Express  that eventually  some of that profitability is going to go back as past device-based comes back. And presumably  that s out very quickly and that you retain a portion of it. I wanted to see  if you could give us a sense of the potential offset from your cost initiatives.,-0.028972923755645752,NEUTRAL
Those numbers  if you look at a couple of years  are they potentially in the same magnitude  And I m thinking in particular of integration of some of the B C shipments for Express and Ground  but that s helpful on the cost side and potentially TNT and maybe you have other things in mind.

So Tom  this is Raj. I ll address it overall. Obviously  it s not possible to give out the numbers by the individual items that you just talked about. However  we -- let me address it broadly by first saying that  the capacity and the commercial carrier -- passenger carriers  we don t expect it to come back in the next    months  maybe more  and we expect the premium to remain for that period of time.,-0.13385502621531487,NEUTRAL

Thirdly  there s a lot of activity that s going on to continue to improve margins in FedEx Express.

Don Colleran,-0.0010582753457129002,NEUTRAL
I think you hit it  Raj. But  clearly  we have a playbook on margin -- improving margin expansion in both our domestic and international business. I think you touched upon and I did in my earlier comments  about why we re confident over the medium term that the supply and demand curve works in our favor.,0.1917712651193142,NEUTRAL
Capacity is light and we think it will continue to remain that way  until people start traveling again on an intercontinental basis. We don t think that happens for the next    to    months  because of the various levels of quarantine restrictions that are in all parts of the globe.,0.07207953557372093,MIXED
We re working one of the things that I would want to highlight that you didn t talk to is  our last-mile optimization plans and the impact that  that has on our margin. I think our Chairman says  density is our destiny. And as we can continue to improve the density in the either of our networks  it s very much margin accretive.,0.17214773781597614,NEUTRAL
We re celebrating the one-year anniversary coming up on last-mile optimization  working very closely with Henry and his team. And we re driving a significant amount of volume through the Ground network. And that  those numbers are accelerating on a sequential week-over-week  month-over-month basis.,0.42747975123347715,POSITIVE
So there s a lot of leverage that we can pull in our business  the European transformation  the domestic transformation. But we have multiple playbooks in play  as we speak  to continue with our margin improvement and expansion.,0.14243546908255666,NEUTRAL
Fred Smith,0.0008781309879850596,NEUTRAL
Let me add something to that. The LMO initiative benefits in two ways. One  it takes lower-yielding residential packages and deferred packages and rural packages out of the Express network  allowing the Express system to concentrate on the high priority B B and the verticals  particularly those that require ancillary services like SenseAware ID  which is on every single box of vaccines that we re now delivering. I mean  it s almost been flawless  the execution of that. And you can count on your hand the number of issues with the number of vaccines we ve delivered in the millions.,0.20549481734633446,POSITIVE
And so  Express is able to be more Express in the B C and the less dense areas are more cost effectively served. So it s not just one side. It helps on both sides  which is what Don mentioned about the density  because as we get more residential packages that are not Express in nature  time definite  or something that somebody needs in a residence that Express has to deliver  it helps Ground s density  its cost  its asset utilization.,0.3681472409516573,POSITIVE
And I think one of the things that I listen to these calls  the last call we had    questions on Ground margins. I don t know. We re not going to have    this time  but we ve probably got half a dozen so far  wouldn t that be close ,-0.08382152393460274,NEUTRAL
So  one of the things that s  hard for us to communicate to this group  Henry has mentioned  is the fantastic effect of this technology that we ve been rolling out. We don t advertise it all the time  but Rob and his team and some of the fantastic work we have going on in other ways  that s why the confidence level is so high  that we can achieve these things in the future.,0.4747292548418045,POSITIVE
So  what you all want us to do is to give it to you in a quarterly forecast and so forth  but some of the numbers that Raj laid out there for you  I mean they re stunning in the productivity improvements. So  I think it s important to look a bit at the bigger picture of some of these things.,0.2592960533220321,POSITIVE
And finally  I ll say  we have a plan to improve Express margins with a lot of passenger capacity in the marketplace and a plan to improve it without a lot of passenger in the market. It s not an either or situation.,-0.017224036157131195,NEUTRAL
And so those are the two recurring questions that come up in these calls. The e-commerce are going to go back because everybody -- the pandemic is over and your margins aren t going to get better and you re not going to do well in Express because the passenger is coming back.,-0.40892020892351866,NEGATIVE
Those are inherent in most of the questions  these last two calls. Both of those are wrong. So  I felt I had to step in finally. I ve tried not to answer any questions  but you re going down the wrong rabbit hole on both of those areas.,-0.4211673871614039,NEGATIVE

I think if I can just offer one more thought. I think it s just like the magnitude  it seems like they re pretty big programs and pretty favorable. So  I think my question was just trying to understand  if you re going to give us a sense of the magnitude at some point. But they may -- I mean  what you re doing at makes a ton of sense and seems to be a big factor in the results.

Mike Lenz,0.003797184966970235,NEUTRAL
Yes. Thanks  and it gives me an opportunity to brag on the team a little bit. So I guess  if there is any surprised me and it shouldn t have is how amazing the team is it that provided this exemplary service. Richard Smith and his organization have done Yeoman s work to make sure that these vaccines move through our network. As Fred said  an extremely high level of efficiency  a handful if that shipments that did not need service.,0.4892017826787196,POSITIVE
I think what s important to note though  when we talk about the vaccines is really not the raw in absolute numbers that move in our network. In the grand scheme of things  when you look at almost    million packages a day moving through our network  this represents a very small portion of that. But what is important to note is a profound impact that these shipments have when they get to destination. And it really just validates our purpose  and it s one we take very  very seriously.,0.12006860366091132,MIXED
The amount of lives that we potentially save  the amount of people we put back to work  amount of small businesses that reopen  the borders that can reopen back to normal levels. That s really the story on that vaccines and that s what we re most proud about. So I guess  the surprise that really shouldn t have been is the amazing work that our team has done to galvanize and be energized around this purpose. And they take that purpose very personally. Get up every morning thinking about the mission that we have to get these vaccines to market  so we can get them in folks on. So I couldn t be more proud of the team in the way that brought these vaccines to market globally. So thanks for asking that question.,0.4569794711424038,POSITIVE
Raj Subramaniam,0.0034921072656288743,NEUTRAL
Yes  let me also jump in on that. I couldn t wait to -- this is one of the most important work that we have done. And to do the work  to be honest  we need a network. And by that  I mean  you ll be able to pick it up in any one part of the world and deposit in any other part of the world in a couple of days. That requires a network. And only a couple of people can actually do -- a couple of companies can actually do that  and we do that very well.,0.42494645062834024,POSITIVE
But you also tied to it  the technology component  the SenseAware ID that Fred talked about that s we rolled that out last year. I mean  it was perfectly timed for the vaccines to provide unprecedented visibility. And we also launched FedEx Surround last year  which provides the AI and ML predictive capability of what is going to happen.

Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to circle back on the new service capabilities that you talked about within international. Is there a way to help us understand or quantify the market hole you re expecting to sell  what drove the development of those products  And any thought on mix  I m assuming it would be a better mix business for you longer term. Any thoughts there ,0.16955502331256866,POSITIVE
Brie Carere,0.012498823925852776,NEUTRAL
Sure. So I think when you think about what we re going -- what we have going on in the fourth quarter  we really actually have three expansions from a service perspective. We will have  actually  we do have the fastest intra-European ground network as we completed the TNT ground network integration. That will provide growth  both from a B B perspective  as well as a B C perspective. So we are absolutely looking to take share intra-Europe  and we see that with the fastest network in Europe. We re confident we can do that.,0.17185480566695333,NEUTRAL
When you think about the intercontinental  we actually  today  have the leading value proposition from Europe to the United States  and we re going to double that. So we are going to have a dramatic advantage over both UPS and DHL. We re adding nine origin countries. So it s going to allow us to really expand both our B B share as well as our B C share outside of the major markets in Europe.,0.25254889647476375,POSITIVE
And then third  as we re talking about FICP  the same story outside of the United States is playing out everywhere in the world with more than     of our parcel growth opportunity coming in  in e-commerce. And we did not have an international product that really had the right features of service for serving this massive growth opportunity. And we are under-penetrated.,-0.2964057382196188,NEGATIVE
Full disclosure  we are behind both DHL and UPS in this market today  so we see there only upside. When you think about FICP  its features of service are different from our core B B products in a couple of ways. Number one  we ve changed the clearance capabilities. So we now have low-value clearance capabilities  or what we call type     which makes it a lower cost entry for the customer. We are automating our clearance capabilities  which reduces the cost to serve. We are changing the terms and conditions on the number of attempts that we will make at the last mile.,0.0005616806447505951,NEUTRAL
And of course  we re rolling out retail access points in Europe as well  so that we can provide that access directly to retail  again  lowering the cost to serve. So in all three of these segments  we believe we ve got market share upside  but probably most specifically  on the overnight service to the United States  it s a B B play. On FICP  it s a rapidly growing opportunity for e-commerce. I hope that helps clarify.,0.08842210308648646,NEUTRAL

Before I speak to our results  I want to acknowledge what an unprecedented year      was. At this time last year we have little idea how much COVID would impact our business and our lives. So many of our customers  crew and fellow citizens were and remain deeply impacted by the pandemic. Our thoughts and prayers remain with them  especially those who lost loved ones.,0.16248916601762176,NEUTRAL
I want to recognize and thank our customers  our crew  our vendor partners and others who came together during the pandemic enabling us to adjust to the realities of operating in this environment. I truly am impressed with how our associates pivoted and embraced the change  relentlessly solving problems for issues we have never faced before.,0.4961004021606641,POSITIVE
Working back from the customer and creating new ways of offering the trend-right products and store experience our customers expect from Five Below.

We will continue to operate with the health and safety of our customers and crew as our top priority  while maintaining financial discipline we have historically demonstrated.,0.29968875928170746,POSITIVE
Now turning to the fourth quarter  our Q  results exceeded the guidance we announced in conjunction with our holiday sales release. Sales were strong leading up to that announcement and accelerated in January fueled by the second round of stimulus.,0.3634863679180853,POSITIVE
We delivered fourth quarter sales of     .  million or growth of nearly      and earnings per share grew nearly     to   .  . Comparable sales were remarkable   .    representing the best Q  comp we have ever achieved. Our e-commerce business continues to grow at a pace significantly faster than our stores  however  due to the small base  the overwhelming majority of our comps still comes from our stores.,0.39135470683686435,POSITIVE
With respect to new stores  which remain our top growth opportunity  we opened two stores in the fourth quarter for a total of     net new stores opened across    states in     . Notably  our Bronx  New York store performed in the top    holiday grand openings even with the more restrictive environment and reduced marketing. We ended the year with       stores  a nearly fivefold increase when we went public in July of       and leaving a long runway for growth to reach the       plus total store potential we continue to see in the United States.,0.12552536372095346,NEUTRAL
Before I speak to the specifics about the fourth quarter  I want to mention the key holiday selling period and acknowledge that both internal and external factors contributed to our strong performance. While our team did an outstanding job ensuring a safe  smooth  and successful holiday  we have benefited from external factors such as a favorable calendar and the ongoing shift in consumer spending from areas like travel and entertainment.,0.2873920299462043,POSITIVE
Regarding the internal factors  from a merchandising perspective  the trend-right amazing value products in our stores resonated with our customers. We saw broad based strength throughout the store  especially in our room  style  sports  and tech worlds. The trends related COVID we experienced throughout the year continued. Room and tech benefited from the work and play-at-home trend  while style captured the direct COVID impact of customers buying masks and hand sanitizers among other items.,0.26174689635809045,POSITIVE
Five Beyond also contributed to sales  both through the permanent offering in new stores and remodels as well as the seasonal Five Beyond wall that was in all our stores for the holidays for the second year.,0.07349095006065909,NEUTRAL
On the marketing front  we continued the shift to digital and fully eliminated our paper circulars  while decreasing our TV reach to approximately     of stores.

Now turning to the year  sales overall for      were nearly    billion  with earnings per share of   .  . We accomplished so much during       while quickly pivoting to adapt to the new environment and new ways of working. None of this would have been possible without our incredible team  who I am so personally proud of.

We accomplished all of this while making strides against our key strategic priorities  namely product  experience  and supply chain  while continuing to innovate.,0.3028921006480232,POSITIVE

Adjusting to customer needs and new trends is what Five Below does very well  as we demonstrated during COVID.,0.4128118261360214,POSITIVE
Let me give you a little more color on what we are doing with Five Beyond and product collaborations.

The customer has responded positively to our new Five Beyond assortment  which is filled with fresh  amazing value items and new categories to our customers.,0.3544184293859871,POSITIVE
In       the Five Beyond permanent section was in approximately     stores  and we plan to more than double that number in       making it available in approximately     of our chain by year-end. We also plan to add the Five Beyond wall in all stores in select New Seasons like we did in January with the wellness offering.,0.1659571034833789,NEUTRAL
In addition  we re working on exclusive online items as part of the overall Five Beyond offering. As to product collaborations  we plan to expand the Bugha gaming offerings  as well as do more exclusive collaborations in     . In fact  we kicked off the year with a new partnership focused on the creative aspects of teens and tweens lives with Andrea Pippins  who s an illustrator and author. The Pippins collections of products helps kids to imagine  create and shine. Our colorful and inspiring teams have been very popular. We plan to create more opportunities like these in other areas cross our stores.,0.15521923222695477,NEUTRAL
Second  as it relates to experience  our goal is to elevate the experience for both our customers and our crew. How do we do that  We do that through innovation  both in store and digitally. In store  we are featuring a new prototype with Five Beyond in the backend store to build new stores and remodels. While our Localhost test was temporarily interrupted by COVID  we will restart this initiative to continue to add more Localhost locations in     . We continue to be pleased with our partnership with Nerd Street Gamers  and see them emerging as a leader in eSports.

We also added a system self-checkout to over     more stores  including the majority of new stores and remodels  bringing the total stores with assisted self-checkout to about     of our chain. This allows us to move our crew from behind the register to the floor  to assist our customers with their shopping journey  which makes for a better customer experience overall.,0.3006788312923163,POSITIVE
On the digital front  we are focused on increasing our brand awareness  and more targeted marketing. As I previously stated  we are focused on the acquisition and retention of our customers through various search and social platforms  and we ll continue to build upon our successful trial with Instacart into     . As for our crew experience  technology plays a key role. And in       we are planning to upgrade our human capital management system.,0.021715895061788615,NEUTRAL

In addition  in       we ve recognized the full year of a pro-rata loss related to our non-controlling interest in Nerd Street Gamers.,0.015334092546254396,NEUTRAL
Our effective tax rate for the year was   .   compared to     in     . The lower than planned tax rate in both years was primarily due to the benefit of share based accounting.,-0.003422682173550129,NEUTRAL

However  I will offer directional commentary on how we are viewing the year.,-0.044992567505687475,MIXED
This first quarter will be very different than last year  when we closed our stores due to the pandemic on March     the Friday following our fourth quarter earnings call. These store closures resulted in the loss of sales for last year s Easter and spring season. With Easter on April    this year  we are currently in the key selling weeks for the quarter. Last year  the pandemic was declared on Wednesday  March   . And we reported a  .   comparable sales increase for that quarter to date period.,-0.31720119598321617,NEGATIVE
For the same period this year  comparable sales increased   .  . Based on our current trajectory and the expected benefit to sales from the third round of government stimulus  we expect first quarter sales to be in the range of      million to      million.

As you know  our practice is to update the tax rate outlook quarterly  with actual results when we report earnings.,0.006085749715566635,NEUTRAL
For the full fiscal year of       although  we are not providing formal sales and EPS guidance  we would like to provide a framework for how we are thinking about the year. We expect it to be a more normalized year from a growth and operating margin perspective. Accordingly  we view fiscal      as a better comparison year for fiscal       than the pandemic impacted fiscal     .,0.0023741237819194794,NEUTRAL
In a scenario where sales growth reflects a two year compound growth rate in the high teens  we would expect fiscal      operating margin to be relatively flat to fiscal     . We expect the second-half of fiscal      to be a difficult comparison  as we lapped a very strong second-half in       when sales grew     and comparable sales were at a record high of   .  .,-0.087127854116261,NEUTRAL

Hey  everyone  it s Simeon Gutman. My question is on incremental margins  and I guess EBIT margins broadly. In Q   I was going to ask around incremental margins.

Yes. Thanks  Simeon. I ll answer the second part of your question first around our leverage points as we move forward. As you mentioned  it is going to be an unusual year anniversarying       but our impression and our -- what we see here from a leverage point  going forward  we have said before about a    comp  ex any meaningful investment for a year  and you should start to see leverage on the business.

And then as we exit the pandemic  I guess  how would you rank opportunities as we think about accelerating market share on the other side more  It goes back  I think the last couple of quarters you ve talked about taking a more offensive approach.

Joel Anderson,0.0006248792196856812,NEUTRAL
Yes  thanks  Matt. And I mean  clearly  we were very forthright about acknowledging both internal and external factors  and I think as you look at the nine-week period  the    -ish comp  that acceleration where the quarter ended at   .    we attributed the overwhelming majority of that to external forces  the second stimulus.,0.3233976401388645,POSITIVE
But if you work backwards to the holiday  and then as well as what we re seeing in the first quarter  I think what you re starting to see  Matt  is a lot of offense coming together to work  certainly Five Beyond played a very large piece of that. Our assortment  the merchants really pivoted nicely  and if you think of the pandemic as a trend  kind of a weird way to categorize it  but our job when something emerges is to move the merchandising mix  and I called out specific examples in both style and room  how the customers  buying patterns change.,0.08298705145716667,MIXED
And I think if we had stayed the same  we wouldn t have seen quite the lift we saw in the back half of the year.

So  clearly the run up at the end was external  but the overwhelming majority of that first nine week holiday was us being nimble and reacting to trends we saw  and the merchant team continues to do a great job. The planners got back out in the market  and we rebought after cancelling hundreds of millions of goods. And I ll tell you  the team Matt really operated on all cylinders to kind of salvage what started out as probably the toughest start to the year we ve ever seen and we ve finished     with momentum and we entered     now with great momentum as well.

And  while we pull back in the back-half of last year  we ve pulled back in the front-half of this year. But we ll shift that back into the back-half of next year.

No  look  I mean  you know Michael and his team. And there s always product innovation.

Good evening. Thanks all for taking my question. Can you break down the ticket growth you saw in  Q  between UPT  and AUR  And what drove those pieces  And given those dynamics and the likelihood that retail traffic  it will likely improve over the course of the year  should we think about Five Below now having a structurally higher comp than a  .   if average from      to      ,0.29062499664723873,POSITIVE

Michael Lasser,-0.0015587651287205517,NEUTRAL
Yes. The second piece is should we think about Five Below having a structurally higher level of same store sales growth moving forward.

Joel Anderson,0.0006248792196856812,NEUTRAL
Yes  I think  Michael that is a great question.

Hi  guys. Good afternoon. You mentioned on the call  Joel that the densification of stores in certain states and now you re going to be in    states. Is there any way to quantify the benefit you guys get from that densification strategy  whether it s sales because of brand awareness  or maybe at the margin line  because you can better leverage expenses  like marketing and distribution  Just any color on that would be helpful just given the expansion process that you guys are going through ,0.05082318186759949,NEUTRAL
Joel Anderson,0.0006248792196856812,NEUTRAL
Yes. It s really both  Scott. And  I mean  sorry about the ambiguity on some of this just because all the noise last year. But look  I think the one thing we are seeing is our brand awareness is something we ve always been watching and it s been rather low. But what we ve really seen year-over-year is our brand awareness in kind of markets anywhere open from two to seven years is moving up   to     to     basis points faster than it used to.,0.03154446929693222,NEUTRAL
And so I can t specifically  due to all the noise last year  tell you it s because of densification. We internally believe that. And we ve shared with you  cannibalization closer to     bps a year. And we re not afraid of that  because I think the payoff s around awareness and picking up market share far outweigh the slight cannibalization from individual stores.

Hi. Congratulations on successfully navigating an extremely difficult year. If you could show some more colors on inventory levels  you exited the quarter down    . Would you say that hindered your ability to capture some sales in the fourth quarter  and you had to leave some on the table. And then what gives you confidence in managing that  especially given all the challenges going on globally  as you think about first half of the year and likely into the second-half as well  Thank you.,0.4673582324758172,POSITIVE
Ken Bull,-0.01150653453078121,NEUTRAL
Yes. Thanks  Chandni. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks  we were down about     on a year-over-year basis from average store. And again  a couple things were going on there. One  you got to look at last year when we were up probably half of that related to the sales and then also we moved inventory in earlier  tariff related inventory to avoid some tariffs there. And then you kind of flip to this year when we oversold right and had some a tremendous sell throughs there in the fourth quarter.,0.1923779994249344,POSITIVE
And then some delayed receipts. I think Joel mentioned the two where  we are seeing some delays related to that global supply chain disruption. But I got to tell you  the team is managing it very well. We don t see a material impact of that related to Q   based on the guidance and the sales that we provided. I guess more to come on that as we move through the year. But right now  we feel like we re in pretty good position with that  and again  navigating that pretty well with our vendors  and then also with the to our supply chain.,0.04087395220994949,MIXED

Thanks. Good afternoon. I wanted to follow up on some of the comments you made on Five Beyond  I think adding more frequent to WOW wall  Can you just talk a little bit about the strategy and if there s a chance that we will see those permanent pictures throughout the fleet at some point this year ,0.3827203707769513,POSITIVE
Joel Anderson,0.0006248792196856812,NEUTRAL
Yes. Great question. And let me just refresh everybody on where we re at with Five Beyond. Because there s actually two components at this point in time. There s the Five Beyond prototype  and then there s what we affectionately call the Wow Wall that s in the rest of the chain. And so  our go forward prototype for the class of     will -- for the most part  all new stores and remodels will now incorporate Five Beyond in the back of the store.,0.286467952770181,POSITIVE
And then the Wow Wall will be used at seasonal times  throughout the rest of the chain. I think it s less about it being in the rest of the chain all year round. And it s more about us continuing to convert and shift more and more stores to Five Beyond prototype.,0.08717855252325535,NEUTRAL
We re obviously pretty pleased with it. We like where it s going. But I also am very respectful who our customer is  what our brand stands for. And I want to walk really carefully with not violating that agreement we have with the customer  namely Five the World. And so  I think the feedback we ve gotten from them is they love Five Beyond  they love the value  the Wow factor  keep delivering that  but also keep it separate and segregated.,0.49922548641552567,POSITIVE
And so  we think we ve found a nice  happy way to do that  with seasonal in and out Wow presentations  and yet moving ahead very quickly. I mean      of our chain will now have the Five Beyond prototype at the end of year. And so that s the nice balance with it. We ll watch it. Could it change over time  Maybe. But I think we re on a pretty good path right now  moving towards this new prototype  and then dropping in some Wow from kind of the timing in the fleet.,0.48457109538139775,POSITIVE

Let me add my congratulations as well on a strong finish to the year. So my question  you talked about the fact that you fully eliminated your -- your paper circulars  and you pull back your marketing in     of your stores. I mean  obviously  this is sort of sort of an extraordinary year. But I guess what are your thoughts as you think about marketing going forward  I mean  I m assuming you re probably not we re going to do paper circulars anymore.

Joel Anderson,0.0006248792196856812,NEUTRAL
Yeah. Hey  thanks for the support Anthony. And look  it we were already on the journey to reduce our dependence on paper. And clearly  the pandemic allowed us to accelerate that. We re not going back. We re pretty pleased where we re at. But I think what we also learned is where we were heading done a pretty strong path of national TV the consumer behavior shifted a lot. And we had much more success with some of our more targeted digital. And so  I think  as we sit here today pending consumer shift again  that ll be the path we will go down.,0.3551117982715368,POSITIVE
We ve seen the opportunity to not have to spend as much marketing  but I think there s still the opportunity for use of performance marketing and reaching into some of our social paid platforms.

Good afternoon. Just on stores  just a question on any metrics that you can provide as we think about your new store prototype regarding productivity or returns  relative to the rest of the base. And also with you kind of breaking ground on the digital center that are open next year  just curious what will be kind of capacity in terms of what you can support through the DC system in      ,0.09755351394414902,NEUTRAL
Ken Bull,-0.01150653453078121,NEUTRAL
Yes  thanks  Paul. Taking the back half of that on the D.C. side  in theory  when the next one is up  it certainly gives us the capacity to support all       stores. Now that doesn t mean you ll never hear us open another distribution center  because at some point in time  you also look at efficiencies and you want a smaller regional and say the Pacific Northwest or something. But our overwhelming heavy lift  multi-year investment phase to which we were honestly kind of behind them  we re now ahead. And so I think we feel pretty good at that as we get Arizona open this year and the Midwest next year.,0.3747641434893012,POSITIVE
Store metrics are tough. I mean  obviously  stores getting more productive. We continue to see less in the remodels we re doing. So we expect those productivity gains to continue to grow. I d ask for a little patience from you guys before we kind of give you specifics  because we ve been trying to parse it out and the remodels we ve done and there s just so much noise from closed stores  open stores  states having different levels of shut downs  stimulus money dropping in.

The cost per available seat kilometer  CASK  was R  .      a nominal increase of     compared to the same period last year  but a    decrease when excluding the exchange rate variation during the same period. In the quarter  the costs strictly related to operated flights  adjusted CASK  corresponded to R  .    .

Hi  thanks. Good morning guys. I guess good afternoon for you. A couple of questions here  a few questions. Lots of cost savings initiatives last year that obviously are helping from a working capital perspective. And I m just wondering if you can elaborate a little bit on what the relief drivers were that came into play in the fourth quarter and how they re going to continue to come into play in       And it seems like the cash outcome in the quarter is different than what we re seeing in the income statement. And so  I m just thinking that there is these initiatives are coming in nicely. I m just wondering if you can elaborate a little bit more on those ,0.22153277043253183,NEUTRAL
Richard Lark,0.0002214662090409547,NEUTRAL
Yes  sure  Dan. A couple of things. Obviously  one is the pure cost component  the other is the working capital component. As you know  we are managing the Company through the pandemic with kind of simultaneous focus on unit costs and working capital  the financial equilibrium. So  I ll kind of answer it in that respect.,0.02970455354079604,NEUTRAL
One  we had about R     million in the fourth quarter  we had about   some of this was work we have done in the Q  that went into the Q  but about   just one second  Dan  I got to fix the phone here. Hold on a sec. Sorry. Four general categories. One was renegotiation of operating liabilities.,-0.2719550672918558,NEGATIVE
Second was leasing. Third was payroll. And fourth was related to working capital that s across the board  that would come on the working capital equation. And one of the components also in the fourth quarter related to how we are managing   matching the operations inflows and outflows. Those are kind of the   meaning  matching our capacity to the actual demand that we re identifying in our operations. So those are kind of the general categories that produce that positive operating cash that you see with the fourth quarter.,-0.1289698895998299,NEUTRAL
Now  I think it s a little bit more important to maybe link your question into the   to the Q . The same categories exists for us and the same levels  in terms of size  would be there. But then in the Q   on a relative basis  in those categories that I described to you  around R     million of sources on working capital come out of renegotiation of operating liabilities. A similar amount on the leasing side of the equation from Q  to Q   which is keeping those same levels that for us was a source of around R     million of savings  if you will. From a cash flow perspective  obviously  some of that impacts costs.,-0.010611564386636019,NEUTRAL
On the payroll  which is the third category I mentioned  about R    million or so  which comes from keeping the same level that we had at the Q  based on our negotiations with the labor force. And then on the working capital financing side of the equation  a little over R     million in terms of what we roll from maturities in the Q  into the future quarters.,-0.041713735554367304,NEUTRAL
And probably I just want to answer that way is that this is like an ongoing management that we ve been doing in this pandemic  which is working to match the cash outflows with the cash inflows. And a big source of it is on the working capital side of the equation in these categories  operating liabilities  leasing  payroll and then working capital that   which has allowed us to maintain the levels of liquidity and cash burn that we are seeing.,-0.025131184607744217,NEUTRAL
On the cost side  specifically  we re reporting good numbers excluding the grounded portion of our operating assets  so that you can see what the unit cost would be without the inefficiencies of the aircraft on the ground due to the pandemic and we ve kind of provided that information in there. But I think I preferred to answer to the question that way in terms of the focus on unit costs. But the sources  if you will  of the savings  the cash flow savings or cost savings  if you want to define it that way  are those categories. Hope that s helpful.,-0.000840798020362854,NEUTRAL

Yes  no  that s great. I appreciate it. Just maybe a couple more questions here.

Are there other steps you could take to shift economics  just given the current crisis ,0.025767426937818527,MIXED

So firstly  regarding the Smiles and corporate reorganization  I hope you understand that we wouldn t like to raise any kind of speculations before the next shareholder meeting  which is scheduled to happen on March     next week. And then we have    days   with Smiles holders  we have    days to decide which option they will choose closing then further  it s going to take a further    days after that. So at the moment  we are not willing to further speculate on any other alternative but having the shareholders deciding on the current proposals. And then depending on the final results  then we could discuss other possible actions.,0.04701429419219494,NEUTRAL
So the second is   did I answer to your question ,0.005714861676096916,NEUTRAL

I appreciate it. Thanks. Yes.,0.49787056245622807,POSITIVE
Eduardo Jos  Bernardes Neto,0.000373097114788834,NEUTRAL
Okay. So the second is related to demographic. Let me tell you specifically in   on two different dimensions. Firstly is geographic. Geographically  there are three important aspects that should be highlighted. The mix of demand by part of the region of the travel hasn t changed much during the pandemic. The Southeast region remains as they start of about     of all passengers  marginally oscillating in the last quarters. The participation of passengers restart again travel at the North region has grown over the quarters.,-0.042518290458247066,NEUTRAL
So looking into the two-year series  the demand originating from the South region has decreased since its participation in the overall demand. Because   this is mainly because the South region has a larger portion of business travelers than on the other ones. And this is specifically the segment most affected by the crisis. The destination mix substantially changed in the last year. The Northeast region  which has a huge leisure potential  grew as a destination and that s possibly a new trend which is going to stay  going to remain even after the COVID. It would be of saying that the Brazilians are finally discovering more the country side and our natural attractive leisure destinations  and that might create a new source of traffic  specifically having the Brazilians travelling more broadly within the country.,-0.09237122442573309,MIXED
And finally the corporate markets  the shuttle markets mainly  the loss of faith in the demand composition. The same happened to South and the Southeast markets  which are now and before for being more corporate markets. So that s an overview we didn t change that much during the pandemic. I believe that we re going to have more leisure travelers to the Northeast region when the pandemic spills over as a new   or not new  but more sustainable and substantial market  and the corporate travel will recover or will resume only after we will have this pandemic over.,-0.3451600759290159,NEGATIVE
We believe   we strongly believe that there are two milestones ahead of us with regards to the pandemic development. Firstly is to achieve the population above    years being confidently vaccinated. And it s reasonable to expect that this effect will happen by the end of the second quarter considering the current vaccination schedule  which has been official shared with the public by the Brazilian health minister. That would drop significantly the number of cases and deaths. And that s also could immolate the same pattern that we experienced for the quarter last year when the average   the daily average of casualties dropped around     from its peak. And this is what we do expect to achieve when the population above    years     years would be immunized. That would represent drop from the current       something casualties per day to something around       or even below.,-0.02247987501323223,NEUTRAL
Those are all overseen numbers  and that s the right word to that   to casualties would be overseen. But considering what we have learned in the first phase of this pandemic  they re using negative correlation between the number of that that cases and the air travel demand. So I believe that by the end of the second quarter  we would see more consistent demand recovery that we are seeing at the moment.,-0.06766284722834826,NEUTRAL
And the second milestone would be around the    -plus of the population would be immunized  that would bring the combination of the so-called herd immunization with the most explosive part of the population being protected and that could drive this to the end of the pandemic. Not the end of the disease   I mean the COVID-    which will stay for years likely  like any other virals  but the pandemic has a good chance to be over in Brazil by the end of the third quarter. We are all engaged and involved in such kind of construction.,-0.00048383884131908417,NEUTRAL
And the third question you raised was related to   please remind me  I m sorry. The health minister  the new health minister.,-0.265006743138656,NEGATIVE

I don t believe in a serious disruption in comparison to what we have done so far  politically speaking.,-0.05641134735196829,MIXED
But I think that the need   the level of   sorry  the level of the urgency has made the a lot around the last weeks and personally  I do expect that we re going to have some good news ahead of us  likely such as pulling ahead some of the vaccines already scheduled to be delivered by the beginning of the fourth quarter and having more efficient public campaigns  incentivizing people  to follow the protocols and this kind of stuff.

Hi  yes. Hey  Rich  Kaki  good afternoon. I want to   Rich  I just want to go back on the liability management. In the investor update  you provide sort of a guide there  where the liquidity is going from R  .  billion to R  .  billion. We know that the cash burn is R   million a day  so call that R     million. In the release  you do go on to say several important initiatives are relevant to ensure that the Company maintains its liquidity at the end of Q .,0.07459289766848087,NEUTRAL
And with Dan you did mention it looked like the four different buckets and it s like   I think it was R     million  R     million  another R    million and then I think you are going to push off R     million maybe on the working cap side. I m not sure if I heard those numbers right. Which then  it doesn t totally add. And I m just curious if you also have just regular debt coming due  number one  sort of part one. Part two is  are you also anticipating an additional transaction to get you to that R  .  billion  Does something else have to happen in addition to the four pillars that you identified  Thanks.,-0.15368254855275154,NEGATIVE
Richard Lark,0.0002214662090409547,NEUTRAL
Sure. Thanks for the question. That s and   I ll just kind of maybe add in there and get a free ride on. We get some questions from the call  a platform  the Internet. Sometimes when I give a little bit longer answer  it s only because I got a question from the screen that s right in front of me now and I try to answer the question of that person together. And so I think complement that we had a question it says  it seems that the debt maturing this year  including leases  exceeds the Company s cash balance. Are you planning to refinance that ,-0.017731420695781708,NEUTRAL
So obviously  we don t pay lease   we don t pay operating expenses from cash balance. We don t pay leases from cash balance. We pay leases from operations. Maybe that wasn t exactly your question but this is how it works. We re a flow company  right. Airline is a flow company  inflows  outflows. And then capital structure it has everything we have in terms of capital structure at GOL is to support the long-term assets. We have no significant capital structure maturities until     .,-0.004363458603620529,NEUTRAL
So just kind of put that on the side for the folks that are looking at the balance sheet and looking at the IFRS     the timing of leases  I mean those are all operating leases at our Company. And   yes  and that bucket specifically  we have been managing our relationships and contracts with the leasing company  keeping them at a minimum level that matches as much as possible with operations.,-0.0714331865310669,NEUTRAL
As you know  when we get our negotiations in the second and third quarter of last year  we ve got a big portion of those into   we transfer the portion of fixed costs into variable costs  which also include a portion of those aircraft in power-by-the-hour contracts with a low portion of fixed cost and then variable cost.,-0.0009403489530086517,NEUTRAL
And so that component is dealt with. But it s important to remember that that portion  in other words  all of the aircraft leasing is treated as on balance sheet debt  and then a portion of that is the short-term component. I m just going to put the capital markets debts on the side. We have no significant maturities until     . We are staying current on interest. In terms of the lease debt  we re able to match that with the level of operating inflows  let s put that on the side also  which get to the heart of your question.,0.01152960117906332,NEUTRAL
Now  the way our Company has worked  our airline  we ve   since the beginning of this pandemic  avoided schizophrenic capital raising and done our best to preserve our non-cash current assets  which are things that you see on the balance sheet like restricted cash deposits kind of those things on the upper left-hand side of the balance sheet. It also includes our hedging activities  legal deposits. And so  we continue to manage the Company in that way  releasing restricted cash and deposits when we need to now within the   and those will finance a part of the overall need  number one.,0.039470864459872246,NEUTRAL
Mike Linenberg,0.0003645744873210788,NEUTRAL
Okay.,0.020046767313033342,NEUTRAL
Richard Lark,0.0002214662090409547,NEUTRAL
And secondly  is what we do in terms of receivables  receivables management  factoring things like that  those balances have come down. But you do see in those numbers there  receivables balance and we factor  sales have ramped down significantly in the short-term  put a lot of pressure on that. And then finally is other   all of those are really on the upper left-hand side of the balance sheet.,-0.18200340121984482,NEGATIVE
Now then we have sources of new funds that come on the upper right-hand side of the balance sheet  outside of what we already have. And yes  we have been able to at this Company   at our Company  we never lost credit from our commercial banking relationships and we ve been able to  when needed  have short-term credit coming in there when we have a deficit from a working capital perspective.,0.06297985836863518,NEUTRAL
And so  if you look at this Q  and this scenario is going to extend into the Q   we ve been able to finance this operating deficit with freeing up of non-cash current asset. And then we also are able to   where that is not sufficient in terms of a timing perspective  meaning that we can unlock our restricted cash  unlock our non-cash current asset  it takes a little bit longer  we ve been able to finance that gap with short-term credit facilities. And that s   and you ll continue to see that going forward. The liquidity that you re seeing now and that we re reporting  last time you saw that here in the recent cycle was August. And when we get down to that level of R  .  billion  R  .  billion  that s really kind of like the absolute minimum for us.,0.000662829726934433,NEUTRAL

Yes.,0.1394587904214859,NEUTRAL
Richard Lark,0.0002214662090409547,NEUTRAL
And we ve been in fact caught  I would say  we did a good job all the way up until around January    of being one step ahead of the game on the pandemic in terms of data analytics and seeing where the demand was.,0.2950760694220662,POSITIVE
And then I think we  like many other countries around the world  airline markets  at least in terms of what we see around South America  Latin America  it was a surprise in the last    days of January  the demand collapse because of this wave of COVID. We immediately at the end of January used our primary tool  which was capacity  because all those deposits are selling capacity demand. And so  we did that work at the end of January. Obviously  there was a phase in February. But pretty much by the end of February  we have done what we need to do on capacity.,-0.28004792518913746,NEGATIVE
And you ve now been seeing publicly and I know you look at the capacity systems religiously every day. You ve seen the ramp down in capacity. But that work was done last    days of January and first    days of February. And then what you saw  competitively  you saw the other companies with a   I don t know  a four to six-week lag  pretty much follow suit on that and pretty much everybody has kind of fallen into the same category. I think we ve had an advantage of having advanced data analytics investment done years ago where we see it immediately. And so for us it was   December was the home to hurricane  and we have to deal with another three or four months of  specifically  the second leg of the hurricanes.,-0.13786658644676208,NEGATIVE
Now  overall  we will be operating at this level of liquidity in the short term. There s a little bit of season   normal seasonality in there that you would have. But it s hard to kind of extrapolate that out. And clearly  you see kind of March  April be the worst month   portion of our capacity would ramp down anyway. But it s hard to extrapolate the effects right now because of everything that s mixed in here. But   and as we said  like the key chuck that s missing  it has been missing  was the large corporate piece. But what happened in the Q   about mid-January  is we lost something that we had was a significant portion of the high value VFR traffic.,-0.0811970136128366,MIXED
And that   and so a little bit of what Kaki was mentioning  it s a combination of   we had restrictions come back in and a little bit   vaccine is around the corner  so people are sort of waiting. But we   in the    months of this pandemic  this is the most restricted we have been here. And also speaking from the perspective of the city of Sao Paulo  which is about          of Brazilian GDP  and the state of Sao Paulo  which is about a third of Brazilian GDP  the economic engine of Brazil  this is the most restricted we ve been in terms of movement and activity  let s say  mobility wise. Having said that  the economic activity is much higher than it was when we first had these restrictions.,-0.05708929058164358,MIXED
And so there s a little bit of that  there s a little bit delay in momentum is happening here  just the restrictions are different. I mean  we have curfew now from      PM till      PM. And so  at      everybody runs home. But they are already set up to do work. But that significantly impacted this kind of high end VFR component because beaches and hotels are effectively closed.,-0.020603539887815714,MIXED
And so that client base that we had  we had to deal with it during the Q . It eroded a bit of our liquidity  probably versus what we had planned coming into the year  probably to the tune of something along the order of  say  R     million or so  maybe a little bit more versus where we expected. And so  we re a little bit lower at amount right now. But we had   a lot of these deals that we had kind of locked in  we have loosened them up a little bit in December and January  and we just kind to clamped down on them again back to where we had already sort of negotiated and set it. That I m saying on the fixed costs with aircraft  with labor.,-0.015649568289518356,MIXED
And then on the   going back to the question that related to the   when you looked at debt maturities. Like I said  we don t have any capital maturities. We don t have any   what we have is really more commercial finance maturities. And those   we re constantly matching those with expectations on future cash flow as well as we can   we ll continue to roll those over even though from an accounting perspective you report those based on   usually report those based on what you have specifically on a contract. So for example  in that maturity stack that you see for Q   there is about R     million on the   on a local debenture we have with two banks  and that gets rolled out into the future for the commercial finance things.,-0.07403174787759781,NEUTRAL
All those commercial finance things  I think we ve been explaining this at a  indiscernible  during this pandemic how the commercial finance works at our Company and we continue to do that. Those aren t   we are not the corporate trustee or WTC trustee or a bond trustee. We don t have any of those kind of structural impediments to do that. But at the end of the day  it s about how effective we continue to be managing working capital. We do not have visibility on   we did not have visibility and continue not have visibility on when the large corporates are coming back.,-0.1942387130111456,NEUTRAL
And now we lost a portion of the short-term booking curve  which is this   that we kind of think it was around     to     of our VFR traffic  which was doing these traveling based on the mobility and the lack of restrictions. This was across the region. I mean  we saw with many of our counterparts at least in South America  and I think even Mexico this kind of     back step affected everybody on a relative basis. But if you look at Brazil right now and you compare it to all the major domestic airline markets around the world  it s the worst right now in terms of this back step.,-0.37015556916594505,NEGATIVE
In fact we re  like almost      negatively correlated with like what s going on in the U.S. in terms of the ramp up in domestic traffic. Our experience tells us that we re probably about    to    days behind what you re seeing happening in the U.S. I can say March where you are  it s going to be May where we are because May where you are might end up going back  right. And so this biological phenomenon that s happening at the end of the day very few authorities seem to have a   the real grip on structure.,-0.06795285642147064,NEUTRAL
But the only point   the final point I would mention  and this is a key point  because everything I was talking up to now allows me to answer a lot of questions on the working capital side. In terms of major sources of new funds  like I said  we did not do   we did not burn up all of our   we have not got any external funding from the government here  like  the U.S. quotes a number  something like     billion has been pumped into the airlines. I don t know what the final number is there  but it s mind-boggling for us here. We have not gotten that. And so we have to be very careful about preserving our tools to access responsible capital.,0.04711291939020157,MIXED
You saw in December we created this secured financing structure. We deposited about      million of collateral in there and   which gives us up to      million       million of financing capacity with a  . -year deal    coupon  we did      million. And so we ve got capacity in there of at least      million. And one of the things that s been important to us through this pandemic  which all of our partners appreciate is we ve been current on interest in all of our   I d say  our Capital Markets Day. And so we did out   and those capital markets deals generally are semi-annual interest payments.,0.07014567009173334,NEUTRAL
We paid around R     million of interest in January. We re so      in compliance with the best   what I consider  the best ESG metric you can have is if you are not in default or in the Chapter     even though that s deep on ESG are looking at more of things like carbon emissions. But we ve kept in compliance with capital markets and that s allowed us to keep our capital market access. Obviously with us  we don t have the luxury of permanent capital market access and so we have to have windows which are a combination of when the market is favorable  the global market is favorable  and those windows of having our quarterly results disclosed.,0.116679429076612,NEUTRAL
And so  that s kind of a little bit longer of saying is that we ve got at least      million of financing capacity in the new secured mechanism that we have created. That s probably our go to mechanism. In the short term  if we need to put some additional cash on the balance sheet  and as you know  Mike  the two rules of capital markets activity when you re seeing from an airline is always remember that an airline always needs more cash and to go to the market when the market wants you to go to market. And those are the rules of the  indiscernible  it.,-0.03563949652016163,NEUTRAL
It wasn t you that told me  the other guys retired. And he d always call me up and he is like  how come you re not raising more capital now and you always think it s going to get better to raise capital. But we re more mature in that respect. We have those tools available. And that s without mentioning the other tools we have. We have mature unsecured securities to trade and have continued to trade decently in the market. We get a lot of reverse inquiries on   if we want to do caps on our unsecured bonds and unsecured convert. And our answer to that is  well  right now we have an even better vehicle  which is the secured vehicle with interest and collateral part.,0.013072565197944641,MIXED
So if we need to  we can go to that. But  of course  we have to be careful and pick our moments because we will have incidents  like if we run out of those things we can t call up our friends in Washington  D.C. and ask us   ask them going to send us     billion  that s not going to happen. So we ve got to survive. But I think it s also meant that we have in an indirect way we ve created a lot of value here with our existing stakeholders across the capital structure  both bondholders and we preserved our latent credit quality.,0.07018298655748367,NEUTRAL
We haven t blown up the right side of our balance sheet. For example  if you compare our end of year      balance sheet with our end of year      balance sheet  you actually see a slight reduction in current liabilities  you see a slight reduction in air traffic liability and you see a lengthening of our long-term debt. In other words  if you just look at the right side of the balance sheet and forget about the left side  the right side of our balance sheet is better than it was at pre-pandemic. But  of course  what has happened is we lost about half of our current assets that were distorted by the pandemic.,-0.07730612717568874,NEUTRAL
I say current assets  I mean the effects of cost of revenues and receivables  but   and so we ve been trying to preserve the right side  so where then the left side of the balance sheet fills up again. And we think that s going to be at some point in the second half of this year you re going to see a company that looks a lot like it looked like in the second half of     . And then also on a unit cost basis  that I was saying in the previous question that the other kind of guiding record that we had here is to do everything we can to preserve our unit cost advantage  so that when we come back on the other side of this we look a lot like we looked at the end of     .,-0.18940946832299232,NEUTRAL
But also we have a couple of very tough months to get through here. We re not   we re trained airline operators  we re not trained scientists in the field of epidemiology or how this is going to be managed. So  we re using the same information you guys have in terms of managing and reacting to this pandemic and the virus.,-0.2513907612301409,NEGATIVE
As Kaki mentioned  we are now   we re probably like two months behind where you guys are in terms of the vaccine roll out but we re starting to get momentum now. I mean  this momentum. If you walk around the street around here and you ve got  what you call it  makeshift   temporary or makeshift vaccination centers set up on the street  and so that infrastructure is starting. But that s against what has happened here over the last month or so where hospitals have gone to full capacity utilization. If that was not the case  we ve probably would have not had the restrictions coming back in.,-0.03981364890933037,MIXED
But because the hospital infrastructure is not sufficient to support what s happening now with the second wave  the government s came in and put in these restrictions to try to help slow down that curve. Without saying  if you remember back when these things started  it s    days to flatten the curve  right  since we are already a leader with the highest curve we ve had. So  that s how I would answer that. And if you have some other questions on  just shoot us an email  we can go into the details on that. I just like to maybe move to the next question. We have another ,-0.15235953964293003,NEUTRAL
Mike Linenberg,0.0003645744873210788,NEUTRAL
Yes  which I would just   yes. I would just add just putting words to numbers  it seems  and to Kaki s point about  we get to September in Brazil and things are on the up and up. The R  .  billion in the March quarter of liquidity  that s your low point  right  because you get to June     and you should be selling July  August  September and people should actually feel better  because the numbers are better. And I think that s the point is that the R  .  billion is the low point  just based on everything you and Kaki have said. Again that s a reasonable conclusion there  but like you said anything can happen. So that s kind of how I am coming out on it based on what you re   you ve been able to give and how you ve been able to manage. But you can ,0.05830572545528412,NEUTRAL

Just to emphasize a little further what we have above said. We could consider the high likelihood that July would be much stronger than we are foreseeing right now  assuming  as I said before  that the population above    years will be already immunized.

Hi  Duane. At the moment  I believe that we might be facing a kind of a phenomenon that happened exactly by the beginning of the pandemic in Brazil. So  some of the players reacting faster or   either reacting faster or see in the radar what s really going on a little bit earlier than the others. Definitely there is  at the moment  a reduction in demand caused by the increase in the COVID case   in the number of the COVID cases in Brazil and that s affecting the forecast quite significantly.

So I believe that there is a series  I could say so  a lack of rationality in the market at the moment. But I believe it s going to be fixed in one or two weeks  considering the current demand weakness. Anyhow  we are not depending on it and we took our measures in order to   as we already   to manage our own performance quite independently of what is being decided by our competitors  but I couldn t tell you that at the moment      of the market is rational because it is not.

And we haven t   we didn t go the route of having debt financing like some of those guys. All the other guys have their own debt financing  so we ve managing it differently. Generally we   for five years now we ve been the leader  at least Brazil domestically  on setting the tone  literally since May of       that s when the things looked over  GOL s been the leader and everyone else has been a follower. That has generally been the case and it varies across the board in terms of the lead lag.,-0.09482978656888008,NEUTRAL
I mean  part of what was Kaki was saying is that  we recognized really quickly in January that what was happening and at the end of January  we started the process of ramping down our capacity. And I think other folks took somewhere between one and two months to come up with that. And I think that s   part of it is our   and it s how we manage the business on a day-to-day basis  part of it is investment that we made in data analytics  which allows us to have maybe a bit   a little bit better handle on that component there.,0.02942977286875248,NEUTRAL

So Duane  we have mentioned it before  it s Eduardo Jos . Actually  we are under a formal waiver until the end of September. So  I mean the IATA summer season is   even at this and we have already engaged in new conversations with the Brazilian authorities because considering the pandemic outrun  it might be that we all will need a further seasonal waiver to be applied. So this is our expectation  which is going to be the waiver is starting   I m sorry the season is starting next October. I mean the IATA winter season. So  we are now addressing this discussion toward the Brazilian civil airline authority and I hope that we re going to have something related to that.,-0.032318493351340294,NEUTRAL
Richard Lark,0.0002214662090409547,NEUTRAL
Okay. Let s just   we re going to   just so we kind of get through all of the questions in fairness to everyone. And we re going to move to next question. But just before that I m going to slip in a question that we got from one of our big investors that asks  your release said that you were able to get a good portion of leases and power by the hour agreements. Do you feel that you continue to have these favorable agreements as travel recovery in developed markets potentially outpaces recovery in Brazil  especially with rising cases and a slower vaccine rollout ,-0.05175614356994629,NEUTRAL
So  the short answer is  yes. I was responding a little bit on the micro question  but maybe drill down a little bit. I mean  we can keep our minimum payment which can be up to about     reduction and continue to extend that if we have a slow recovery. Also given potential new taxation on leases  GOL can get some grace in March and April to preserve payments. Power by the hour is on about half of our contracts  the other half for deferral related  in that situation deferrals would be expanded. And our lessors are supportive and understand the situation  we continue to work on that with them.,0.04059826396405697,NEUTRAL
That ends up working out to be that we would in that worser scenario  we end up paying now more than about     of our lease payments according to our agreements. And also it goes into one of the previous questions as well  when folks look at the on-balance sheet accounting of the short-term lease payments versus what would actually happen when you look at that number. If we need it to  the number could be half of what that short-term liability is on the balance sheet  which is  if I remember correctly. But that s not how we manage the business in terms of looking at the on-balance sheet next    months lease payable. But the difference there would be about R   billion of cash savings during fiscal     .,-0.2530256425961852,NEGATIVE
So now we can go to the next question. We have another three question  the people in the queue here. We ll try to get through them to the top of the hour  where we need to switch to our Portuguese call  as everybody knows we do these things in both English and Portuguese. So  please  next question.,0.005642950534820557,NEUTRAL

Hi  good afternoon  everyone. I will probably ask two couple of quick questions. First  Kaki  to your   in your response to Dan  you talked about kind of the phases of recovery. I m just kind of wondering what your corporate clients are telling you in terms of what they need to see to get comfortable returning to kind of business travel ,0.1522196615114808,NEUTRAL
Paulo Kakinoff,8.184103353414685e-05,NEUTRAL
Yes. Savi  that s including three different groups. I mean       sorry  one-third of the business travelers never stopped flying in   even during the pandemic  so those are the essential workers that helps sustain this kind of business attention forever. And this is  I would say  the base levels which never change. The second group  another one-third is made of large corporates that those are under human resources policies that are blocking down of flying. So I believe this is the group that we referred sort of resume when the pandemic will be either under control or probably over.,-0.2273829821497202,NEGATIVE
And then you have another portion  maybe one-third  which I believe two-thirds of this  one-third  possibly will take much longer are or maybe even not come back. Those are the travelers that we will replace with the business travel by one of the new technology such as video conference and these kind of stuff. I believe that when I say that  we will have from the third quarter on more business. So that s resuming their old habits  I believe that we will have on top of the current one-third who s still traveling  we would be another third  maybe    percentage points on top of the     is still flying.,-0.11322500556707382,MIXED

Savi Syth,-0.002291992772370577,NEUTRAL
That was perfect. That s very clear. Thanks  Kaki. And then Richard real quickly  just on the fuel hedging front what s in place for      and are you doing anything more than I m guessing not  but just curious in a quick update on the hedging ,0.49760150132715353,POSITIVE
Richard Lark,0.0002214662090409547,NEUTRAL
Sure. We continue to do a pretty good job of dealing with that. It s been less important. Our normal objectives are related to margin management and basically permitting enough time to adjust yields to pass on cost increases  that s been pretty much irrelevant during this pandemic. We came into the first quarter  with about a     hedge ratio for      and     hedge ratio for       in the low-  s  if you will. And what we did during Q  is we   when we hit our view triggers in the low-  s on oil  that s been what I was saying  I think it was in the first question that those gains  if you will  are   if you will  a non-cash current asset. And so  I think during this pandemic  if you go from the beginning of the pandemic until now  we probably had   probably close to somewhere between R     million  R     million of cash inflows because of gains on our fuel hedge position. It s not really much to hedge against given the demand dynamic here and the inability to do yield management period. But once yield management comes back on  you will expect to see it. But it s a little bit lower than those hedge ratio I mentioned. It s not relevant for us right now. It s how we re managing the business. And we   actually  our view is things have overshot a little bit now. So we re not going to be putting on any new hedges at this level right now in terms of our fundamental view on that.,-0.04902026802301407,MIXED
And so I m going to now move to   before we move to next question  I m going to fit in one more of the questions we re getting from the   on the platform here  just to kind of be efficient with the time. And the question was basically  to what do you attribute the drop in your total liquidity from the end of Q  to the end of   what you re expecting from end of Q  in your perspectives ,-0.023475568741559982,NEUTRAL
Answer to that would be our accounts receivable dropped about R     million over the course of the first quarter here      . We finished   December  we finished with around R     million in accounts receivable and now we have about R     million  that s related to the drop in the forward booking curve. And this is a temporary effect. We had around R   billion a month on average throughout the year of accounts receivables pre-pandemic  that balance right now is about R     million. As I said in Q   that was around R     million. Now  if we had the same level of receivables with the forward booking  today we would have liquidity of about R  .  billion to R  .  billion. So I hope I answer that.,-0.2919700872153044,NEGATIVE
So now let s go   we can squeeze in one more question here. And it looks like I m not going to be able to get the last question Matt  but you can   we can set up a call later. We can move to the last question here  operator.,-0.10664468258619308,NEUTRAL

Thanks very much. Hey  Richard. So thanks for the opportunity. I have a couple here. One is  on the debt amortization that is expected for the  Q       it s about R     million.

Richard Lark,0.0002214662090409547,NEUTRAL
Yes  again   okay. Yes  because we got  we have to respect everybody s time here and we can also go into the math with you offline  but basically   contractually  we have those maturities  but the majority of those are commercial finance  which are with a specific counterparties and we basically rolled those over. And so we don t have majority of those maturities. We don t have as cash outflows from an amortization perspective  but we have as interest expense maintenance. So that s basically it.,0.029710769653320312,NEUTRAL
I can go into the details with you offline  so we can get to that. But there s   as I mentioned  its R     million of the cashes in there and then there s about another R     million or so of commercial finance that it s   as I mentioned during this pandemic  every single quarter and every single quarter  we get the same question. We re constantly working to match those cash outflows with cash inflows and staying current on interest to preserve our credit access. So that s about R     million of those numbers you mentioned are in that category. And then the rest  the GAAP there is just how we manage working capital. But if you need more than that  we can talk offline. You said you had another question.,0.03926754742860794,NEUTRAL
Rog rio Ara jo,0.05301337782293558,NEUTRAL
Yes  thank you  Richard. And next question is regarding yields. So with the current effect depreciation and the oil price expansion  what kind of yields does the company need to be profitable in terms like  can you say the amount of expansion in yields necessary versus      levels or something like that for the company to be as profitable as before also considering all the efficiencies that you have implemented in during this crisis ,0.08045090734958649,NEUTRAL
Richard Lark,0.0002214662090409547,NEUTRAL
Yes. When you saw in the Q  those levels  because  remember I was mentioned before  we ve had two main ways of measuring the company during this pandemic. One is on the unit cost side  and second is on the equilibrium side. That if you look at the adjusted profitability in the Q  EBITDA margin  EBIT margin  those are the levels that we had pre-pandemic in terms of profitability. Excluding the aircraft on the ground  which is that piece of assets that we re keeping so that we have the   as opposed to returning those assets  which we could  if we wanted to returning those and then contracting those back  we don t think it s necessary. So those aircraft that we have today on the ground are going to be necessary on the other side of this pandemic  which we believe is going to be in the second half of this year.,0.022151075303554535,NEUTRAL
And so the Q  numbers that you saw on an adjusted basis  excluding the ground enforcement of the fleet is that s the level of profitability that we need. And that s the level of profitability that we have  we have pre-pandemic. So that s latent in our structure right now. There is a little bit of inefficiency there in terms of aircraft utilization. We re not near  we want to be on that  but I think that s the best indicator of how we ve been managing our company. Another way of saying it for you  if based on the current economic right now with the current level of operating costs  cash  which is being affected by the pandemic   comparing  let s say fourth quarter   on the fourth quarter       we had that EBIT  the yield would be R  .  . And so use that  however you want to use it  because I know you do a lot of work on the yield side of the equation and you re looking at things like that.,-0.20224697329103947,NEGATIVE
And so on a recurring basis that R  .   yield compared to a R  .   cash it gives us that very nice positive EBIT  but you d take a total basis  which includes all the aircraft on the ground inefficiency that s breakeven  R  .   minus R  .   is zero. And so that s kind of how we manage the business to the Q . And so on a fully loaded basis  we had that breakeven in the Q   but on a recurring basis  which we ve been trying to give you guys this data in the release  it s a lot of work for us to kind of give you that actively so that you can use that  because it d be very difficult for you to come up with that on your own positive. I think that positive EBITDA of about R  .   for ASK.,0.07890743017196655,NEUTRAL
And if you look at our competitors  they re not even close to matching between yields and unit cost. And that s how we ve been managing our company. I m not saying that the other guys are they re managing it for whatever other objectives we ve had  but we ve got two primary directives during this pandemic. One is to make sure that we keep our unit cost advantage and that we come out of this. We have a unit cost that is equal to or lower than where we came in  and then a proper matching of assets liabilities during the pandemic. The yield component and this is important  right  I mean  today  the yield is pretty much given to us. The demand is given to us. We don t have   the normal tool of yield management in the traditional sense really doesn t exist today. We don t have the ability to either stimulate or repress demand today just because of where demand is and the capacity. And in fact  I think  I saw your report and you were highlighting the overcapacity. I mean  if you look at it on a fully loaded basis yes  with the grounded aircraft versus the current demand  that s   at demands that we have today  obviously there s overcapacity  it s going to depend on how people manage those aircraft on the ground.,-0.10373740270733833,NEUTRAL
You ve seen what we ve been doing. I mean  last year  we returned    aircraft and received three aircrafts. As we re transforming to MAX  we re the only company that you ve covered that returned aircraft last year. And we have the ability to do that  and we have the continued ability to do that. And we ve given you some insights on what we re thinking about for this year as well  we re going to   we re planning on returning another nine aircrafts  and then that hopefully will be replaced by MAXs is coming in as we get back on our fleet transformation. And that s the key to the unit costs. Because again  it s like for us  we start with the unit cost  the yield  generally  we re trying to optimize it  given the demand that we re given. And normally in a normal environment  we have a pretty good ability to do yield management with our large corporate and managing it through the acute seasonality that we have here in Brazil.,-0.011994138360023499,NEGATIVE
But right now  anyone that tells you  at least in our market here  that they re doing yield management  either doesn t know what they re talking about  or they re selling your bill of goods  because we do not have the ability to stimulate demand with fares. And also  the demand that that s there today is not necessarily being suppressed if we increase fair. So  keep that in mind that probably continues for at least a couple of months until we get back on track here with normal yield management.,-0.21756056137382984,NEUTRAL

Our three operating segments participate in large addressable markets that benefit from the e-commerce increase due to behavioral shifts from the pandemic. We re confident that this shift is a lasting trend to continue well beyond the pandemic. We have a unified go-to-market positioning as an omnichannel customer experience company and believe we have a highly differentiated products and service offering. Equally important  we have strong client relationships in high-growth categories such as Financial Services  CPG  Healthcare and B B tech  with room to grow and with a new leadership team focused on adding value to these relationships and beyond.,0.28416071928222664,POSITIVE

Thank you  and congratulations on your quarter and positive EBITDA in the fourth quarter. I know you operate in a very difficult environment as many media companies  and you did   you executed very well. I appreciate that. So a couple of questions. Since the company is organized now into three operating segments  can you kind of talk a little bit about how each segment is where there   where most of the revenue is derived from  like in terms of categories like  for instance  maybe you could just talk about the accounts or   what accounts for large portions of the revenues in each one of those segments ,0.341035395860672,POSITIVE
Andrew Benett,0.0006840003043180332,NEUTRAL
Yes  we can   I can start  and obviously  we ll give you client categories. So our Marketing Services business is essentially a CRM business  a CRM agency that has a few components in it  everything from strategy to creative  to technology to implement e-mail solutions. So when you think about that business and as we think about that business  you would look at competitors within the big holding companies in their CRM pure-play agencies. Our Fulfillment   Logistics business does multiple aspects today of fulfillment  literature fulfillment  product fulfillment  and then we also do trade marketing fulfillment would be the three biggest categories.,0.0549132086453028,NEUTRAL
As you re aware  there s been a decline in literature fulfillment as a category as there s less printing as a whole. So when you look at three components of the business as it stands today  we see growth in product fulfillment  which is obviously what B B and B C e-commerce is about. That is e-commerce product fulfillment. And then our Customer Care business  as I mentioned on the call  is transforming  and the majority of the revenue  those are all based on a number of seats with any given client for the services. What I would say is that the transformation that we ve made has been to offer more technology services as well. And so we see that business transforming as well over time.,0.008615758270025253,NEUTRAL

Lauri Kearnes,0.0008425448904745281,NEUTRAL
Sure. I think we have seen a great increase in that. And some of what we thought would be short-term project work that continued into longer than we had planned. But there s still a portion  maybe between     and      that what we would consider project work that s not necessarily recurring. But I think that there s still opportunities to continue to grow that and expand in some of that project work that we can continue to do even if its six months to a year-long project rather than a short period.,0.10295429173856974,MIXED

Andrew Benett,0.0006840003043180332,NEUTRAL

Lauri Kearnes,0.0008425448904745281,NEUTRAL
Sure. I mean  as we stated  we cut from   through restructuring efforts over     million. Certainly  some of our costs normally would fluctuate with the revenue. We re continuing through our restructuring that we expect to complete in     . And as you know  we ve discussed before  reducing our facilities footprint has certainly been a focus as well as some IT projects we ve had going on. We re also embarking on an implementation of a new cloud-based ERP system that we expect to drive additional efficiency in the business and enable us to reduce costs further in the coming years  especially in our overhead-related costs.,0.04259125329554081,NEUTRAL

Got you. And in terms of   I know the efforts last year were   and a year before were to reduce third-party vendors cost and so forth. Where do you stand on most of your third-party vendors at this point in terms of further cost reductions there  Or are you satisfied to cut most of the cost that you need to in that area ,-0.21910999715328217,NEGATIVE
Andrew Benett,0.0006840003043180332,NEUTRAL
Yes  we have. First of all  with regards to third pay vendors  we have completely. Secondly  we ve also   and we ve discussed this in the past  our goal is to be as asset-light  and that s not just from a real estate footprint standpoint  which we ve made tremendous progress over the last few years. But also in terms of technology  as an example. So in our Fulfillment   Logistics business  we re moving towards a much more open architecture  OMS  WMS and reducing our own internal labor for development. So not only are we not reliant going forward on third-party vendors  but we re also not reliant on fixed cost or we won t be as reliant on fixed cost to maintain systems and deliver our work.,0.0513198496773839,NEUTRAL
Michael Kupinski,-0.00022988670389167964,NEUTRAL
And then finally  just a clarification. You guys gave information on the pipeline of business. Can you just kind of give me a sense of how we should look at the numbers that you provided in terms of how this translates into revenue going forward and over what time frame ,0.03460194170475006,NEUTRAL
Andrew Benett,0.0006840003043180332,NEUTRAL
Yes. So the   as we ve talked about  we like to see the weighted pipeline that s weighted at     or higher on conversion  likeliness to convert at   tracking at about     million. Obviously  the quality of a pipeline is as important as the numbers. Where we feel encouraged is that the quality of what is in there is of higher quality than in the past.,0.1327019827440381,NEUTRAL
So what I mean by that is by design and how we re selling it  our clients and prospects are engaging with more than one service  as an example. So it s a higher quality  higher ticket item  but it s also leveraging more services. So one way to look at it  obviously  is that number. But the other way  which is obviously tougher to see  is the quality. And as we announce more and more client wins and you see the types of client wins  that s another way to see the transition and the work that we re doing  which is towards higher margin  higher ticket item work across all of our businesses.,0.03410574048757553,MIXED

Although  what s quite interesting to me is the overall construct of the business in combination with the improvements we ve made to our balance sheet. All in all  our performance during the first half of the year gives us excellent momentum as we push towards the back half of fiscal    . It also sets a firm foundation for further margin expansion as we look to FY  .

I d now like to share a pie chart which is indicative of our commercial portfolio. Slide   underscores the effectiveness of our approach and the base from which we operate.

Moving to Slide    I ll address our updated outlook for the year. We now believe core earnings will be in the neighborhood of    a share  an increase of     from what we anticipated back in September with top line revenue coming in around    .  billion. This incremental revenue improves our portfolio as evidenced by another    basis point increase to core operating margin which we now forecast to be  .   for the year. Lastly  we remain committed to generating a minimum of      million in free cash flow  a testament to how we re managing our capital investments. As I wrap up the outlook  it s notable that our strategy is working  our path is well understood and how we go about producing results is important. On this last point  when we think about the how  we think about purpose  a purpose that guides us in our journey  a purpose which is grounded in a series of behaviors  behaviors such as keeping our people safe  servant leadership  ensuring a fully inclusive environment and giving back to our communities around the world.

Thank you  Mark  and good morning  everyone. As Mark just detailed  our second quarter performance was outstanding driven by the combination of broad-based end-market strength and associated leverage  and improved portfolio mix and excellent operational execution by the entire Jabil team.

Given the additional revenue  I am particularly pleased with the strong leverage we achieved during the quarter which enabled us deliver a strong core operating margin of  .  .

Turning now to our third quarter guidance. DMS segment revenue is expected to increase     on a year-over-year basis to   .  billion  this is mainly due to strong end-market outlook. EMS segment revenue is expected to be   .  billion  an increase of    on a year-over-year basis. It s worth noting our EMS business remained strong and healthy. The modest increase is reflective of our previously announced transition to a consignment model in the cloud business.

Next  I d like to take a few moments to provide an update on the long-term secular trends underway across our businesses which we believe will drive sustainable growth across the enterprise in FY     and beyond. In healthcare today  the industry is undergoing tremendous change due to rising costs  aging populations  the demand for better healthcare in emerging markets  and the accelerated pace of change and innovation. Consequently  we are witnessing healthcare companies shifting their core competencies away from manufacturing towards innovative and connected product solutions. We re in the early days of outsourcing of manufacturing in the healthcare space. On top of this  we are also seeing the impact of connectivity and digitization across healthcare. I expect these trends to accelerate over the next few years. Our deep domain expertise within the healthcare industry uniquely positions us to build technology-enabled products that help our customers excel in today s evolution of healthcare.,0.04582921229302883,NEUTRAL
Another end-market experiencing a rapid shift in technologies is the automotive market. Today  electric vehicles account for less than    of total vehicles in the market. Climate change  fuel efficiency  and emissions are ongoing concerns and regulatory policies worldwide are beginning to mandate more eco-friendly technologies. As a result  OEMs are making a substantial investment into vehicle electrification effort. Jabil s long-standing capabilities and over    years of experience and credibility in this space has positioned us extremely well to benefit from this ongoing trend.,0.17162247275700793,NEUTRAL
Turning now to  G   G will transform the way we live  work  play and educate. As the underlying infrastructure continues to roll out   G adoption is accelerating. Jabil is well positioned to benefit from both  the worldwide infrastructure rollouts and with devices which would be needed to recognize the full potential of a robust  G network.  G is also accelerating secular expansion of cloud adoption and infrastructure growth. This  coupled with the value proposition Jabil offers to cloud hyperscalers  is helping us gain market share in an expanding market  evidenced by the significant growth over the last three years. The value proposition that continues to resonate with our customers is our design to dust capabilities which incorporates engineering  manufacturing and eco-friendly decommissioning observers  ph   all within collocated facilities. This is incredibly powerful as accelerating cycle times  security and transparency at every step of the hardware lifecycle become continually more important to our US domicile hyperscalers.,0.15324389419401996,NEUTRAL
Shifting now to packaging  we are uniquely positioned to benefit from the global shift to smart and eco-friendly packaging. As consumers become more informed about the environmental impact of plastic waste  demand for sustainable packaging solutions is accelerating. And then finally  within semi-cap  the demand for semiconductors has never been higher with the accelerated convergence of technologies and the associated data generation and storage needs. Nearly every part of the economy runs on silicon today. Jabil serves the semi-cap space with end-to-end solutions  spanning the front-end with design and complex fabrication equipment along with the back-end with validation and test solutions.,0.15907604282256216,NEUTRAL
In summary  I m extremely pleased with the sustainable broad-based momentum underway across the business which has allowed us to deliver much better-than-expected results in the first half of FY    . As we turn our attention to the back half of the year and beyond  we fully expect the long-term secular tailwinds that are driving our business to continue. This coupled with our improving portfolio mix and lower interest and tax expenses has given us the confidence to meaningfully raise our FY     estimates for revenue  core operating income  core margins and core earnings per share. We now expect core operating margins to be  .   on revenue of approximately    .  billion  ph . This improved outlook translates to core earnings per share of approximately   . And importantly  despite the stronger growth we remain committed to delivering free cash flow in excess of      million for the year. We ve been working extremely hard as a team to grow margins  cash flows and positively impact our interest and tax.

You re guiding now to    .  billion that s almost a billion dollars higher than the previous guidance. But the operating margin is still guided at  .  .

Thanks  Ruplu. I feel good about where the margin. I think you re right  we look at the overall corporate margin for the year  we think we ll be around  .  . And EMS will be in the range of I would guess  .     .  . I look at that relative to fiscal    . If I go back that far  and I think EMS in      was around    all in. Last year  we re below that and I acknowledge that was a COVID year with excessive COVID expenses. But I feel pretty good about that business overall. I think we re doing the right things in cloud. I look at that business today in terms of a mix of legacy business  some businesses that we ve gotten a bit of a nudge or help with COVID.

Adam Tindle,0.0006217078771442175,NEUTRAL
Okay  thanks. Good morning. Mark. I wanted to start with a question on operating margin and acknowledge it s been very strong so far. A two parter  ph  just on near term and long term moving forward. So first on near term  your Q  guidance implies that total company operating margin is going to be down  maybe somewhere around mid-   range or so and then back up to around    or so in Q   based on the EPS guide if I got that correct  doesn t look like that s volume related because revenue is going to be flattish during this time. So  maybe just more color on drivers of the Q  dip and rebound in Q . And secondly  you mentioned longer term as you exit this year with a four handle. The trajectory that that puts you on as you think about fiscal     and beyond  because you said you wanted to build on that ,0.06485001742839813,NEUTRAL
Mark Mondello,0.008267490338766947,NEUTRAL
Yes  thanks Adam. Q  is always a little bit of a debit for us. And  as much as we take a lot of I don t know if the words pride we feel really good about the overall mixing of the business. What we ve done in the last two  three years. But again  we always see a little bit of a soft spot in terms of enterprise level  in terms of up margin. I think you re right  enterprise margins for Q  will be around the  .   range. And  again  I compare that to last year  which maybe it s nonsense  because of COVID it s up substantially year-on-year. I m going off a memory  but I got to believe that if we went back to fiscal      we d be up year-on-year in terms of Q  to Q  as well. So none of it has anything to do with reflection of the business other than for certain parts of our business as you know  Q  tends to be more of an investment quarter on an OpEx line than the other quarters. The thing that I m focused on more than anything is beginning of the year.,0.0440167561173439,NEUTRAL
So we ve had  we ve strung together  I don t know  adding four  five years where the overall enterprise up margin line has been bouncing around  .  . That says we ve really been focused on adding good quality growth to the company. And in September  we gave an outlook that said for the year we do a four handle on up margin.    days ago in December  we took that up to four one now we re taking that up to four two. So I feel  I m more focused on that trajectory than the quarter-on-quarter results. And in terms of your comments forward looking beyond      we ll give more detail around that in the Investor Day in September  I had said something in my prepared remarks today around the fact that we re very focused on continuing a positive direction with margins as we get into fiscal    . And that would be relative to the four two  that we hope to post this year.,0.02988588437438011,NEUTRAL

Got it. And maybe just as a follow up for Mike  you talked about being able to plan to generate over      million of free cash flow this year  wondering if that s also something that you can build on like Mark s comments on operating margin as we think about a go forward basis  or are there are CapEx investments to achieve that operating margin improvement  And maybe you can just tie in your capital allocation priorities as you answer that question  Thank you.,0.036354031413793564,NEUTRAL
Mike Dastoor,0.0027893070073332638,NEUTRAL
Thanks  Adam. Yes  definitely free cash flow will  I think we ve said more than      million for this year  as we continue into FY    . I expect that to continue to grow. Again  we ve said this before CapEx is something where we ve been extremely disciplined in that  .       range. So free cash flows next year again  we ll get guidance in September  but I expect that to go up on a similar unraid  ph  as it s done in FY    . As relates to capital allocation Adam  we continue to be sort of well balanced. We continue with our buybacks. I talked about our buybacks in my prepared remarks  we have to earn     million left of our authorization  we intend to complete their authorization in Q  and Q  or in the second half of the year. So that shows that we re extremely committed to the buyback program. And that will continue into         . I don t want to preempt anything now. But I m sure we ll be continuing that progress from a buyback standpoint. Most of the  I think we laid out a few quarters ago the capital allocation percentages  roughly half buys into buybacks  dividends  some of the balance of that goes into debt restructuring and the balance would be opportunistic  sort of M A as well. So well balanced. Capital allocation continues going forward.,0.2916984618641436,POSITIVE

Thank you and good results. If I look at your updated guidance on the buy segments  am I correct that the  G wireless and cloud is the one that kind of is giving you the most surprise there  And if so  are any of your segments or all of them or any of them experiencing semiconductor shortages  Are you able to procure all the components and items needed  Thank you.,0.4968772421198082,POSITIVE
Mark Mondello,0.008267490338766947,NEUTRAL
Thanks  Jim. I assume you re talking about our eight sectors  ph . Yes  so  I m not quite sure we mean  in terms of surprise  in terms of the uplift  for sure. So I don t know that it s a surprise to us that we re seeing strength in  G and cloud. Back in December  we knew that there was going to be some component shortages and constraints. But we ve been very bullish on the  G wireless infrastructure and cloud area of our business. So whether surprised or not  it s certainly an area where we continue to see strength. And I think that s largely both on the  G side and the cloud side. Our services and our solutions are being well accepted and embraced out in the marketplace. So feel really good about that area of the business. In terms of supply constraints  I would say that we talked about this a bit in December  let s say  nine months ago  or so. You know  there was demand drops everywhere  based on COVID. I think that people took a lot of their demand signals  cut them abruptly. And then  at least our conversations with our customers  very few people anticipated the rebound that we ve seen  which largely started August  September timeframe  and a bit to our surprise is continued to be very strong through early stages of     . And on the supply side  again  all of that drove constraints.,0.09759610146284103,NEUTRAL
One good piece of information  I think to share is any type of supply constraints  whether it be around resin  whether it be around silicon  whether it be around passives  whether it be around mechanicals all that s handicapped into our numbers and I would actually say that we took a fairly deep handicap to that for our Q  and Q . So I feel if anything  maybe there s some slight upsides to what we ve put out today  assuming that the supply constraints don t work and worse. And the other thing I would say is  I think the procurement team at Jabil just simply the best team in the business. And if I think about our scale  if I think about our holistic approach to demand planning  whether that cuts across healthcare or mobility or EMS business or automotive  our team s knowledge of the marketplace  the knowledge of the commodities  knowledge of technologies  and in the long standing relationships we have is really allowing us to navigate what otherwise is a tough component market at the moment. So I feel we re getting along and getting by quite well  all things considered on a relative basis.,-0.001779414713382721,MIXED

So if you can provide some color into how it performed during the quarter  both top line and margin and where you are on the margin journey  you know  referencing back to when you first did the J J deal  And then secondly  I m just trying to understand make sure I understand the that the cash flow target staying at      million plus  you have higher EBIT  but it sounds like higher inventory investments. Is that basically the puts and takes versus    days ago  or is there anything else  Thanks.,-0.10721931979060173,NEUTRAL
Mark Mondello,0.008267490338766947,NEUTRAL
Yes  thank you. So on the healthcare side  I think we re -- I think we continue to hit it on all cylinders. Steve Borges  ph  and his team who run that business  we started talking about the JJMD relationship. I don t even know how long ago now to  .  years ago  we kind of laid out a roadmap there and our health care team has executed nearly flawlessly to the roadmap that we laid out. So feel good about that and then the business around the JJMD. And I talked in my prepared remarks about different trends. And the team is really focused on things like for health care  like personalized health  like digital health. We announced sometime during the quarter  another relationship that has everything to do with technology around auto injection and auto injectors. And so I just look at the technology  the investments that our healthcare teams are making  and feel really good about that. Our healthcare and packaging business  speed  last year  I think was in the neighborhood of   .  billion    .  billion. And I would guess  as we exit this year  health care and packaging  we ll be bumping up against    billion. And I think we ll continue to see good solid growth in that area for the next two to three years.,0.4323642903473228,POSITIVE
In terms of the      million of cash flow it s another number that I feel really good about and on the surface. Maybe it s a little bit confusing  because EBITDA is going up and margins are going up. So why wouldn t cash flow go up  We have been working diligently to continue to shape the portfolio. Our number one focus as our leadership team is cash flows and management over the next two  three  four years. I think if we ever get to a point where as a leadership team  we decide not to grow the company. That would be a perilous thing to do and makes no sense to us as long as we re adding good quality business  again  attached to secular trends that allow us to continue to expand margins  as we look at     and    . So if I take you back to the beginning of the year  we said we do    .  billion      billion in revenue. Now we re bumping up against     billion     .  billion. And with the additional top line with the way the teams managing working capital  the way the team s managing CapEx  and then Mike alluded to the fact that we were going to complete our buyback authorization by August    of the year.,-0.037216734141111374,MIXED

Yes  thanks for taking my question. You talked earlier of  a platform for better margins in the future. And they re really improving. And I m just wondering  Mark  if you can talk about how much of this is structural in the industry itself  And how much of it is under your control  What is that you are doing today that makes you feel sure that you re locking in higher margins in sort of medium term ,0.45297705847769976,POSITIVE
Mark Mondello,0.008267490338766947,NEUTRAL
I don t know that it s structural to our industry. I hope so. I think if our competition can lock in higher margins that s always good but we re pretty inwardly focused  Paul. I think about first and foremost we obsess about customer care and customer solutions. And I think  if we don t get that out of order  Paul  and we continue to obsess about our customers and what they need in solving their issues  the financials will follow. If I step back and I look at this fiscal year  I was noticing something over the weekend  this will be along with the margin trajectory  I think this would be the first year we ve ever had in the history of the company  if we execute  and that s a big capital  if but if we execute  we re going to string together four consecutive quarters where every single quarter is at or exceeds    per share. And that just kind of jumped off the page. But in terms of margin expansion  you asked about is it structural  I think so. That s our plan and that s what will allow us to take margins up from the  .    as we get into next year.,-0.016891632229089737,MIXED
And I think about everything from our balance sheet  if you take a look at  and again  now I m coming at it a little bit more from an EPS perspective. But since you asked the question around is it structural. Our balance sheet continues to improve  net debts going down  interest expense is going down. Overall  liquidity has gone up. And then I take a look at the business and I look at things like I think we have very  very good overhead and overhead costs  I think about overall demand  I think about the secular trends that we ve talked about  sometimes that s a really  really overused term. But we are truly embedded in so many of those markets  which I think are going to be around for the next two or three years. And then  the whole COVID thing  it s not behind us yet. But with the vaccine being here  we hope to have          of our employees globally have access to the vaccine over the next six to eight months. It s just and then I think lastly  and we ve been talking about this for    to    quarters is the mix of our businesses as healthy as it s ever been.,0.10579161532223225,NEUTRAL
So I think you shake all that stuff up together. And again  I take a look at the last couple years margins have been around  .  .

So can you talk to us a little bit about how you shaped the portfolio and what you do at the front end to prevent low margin business coming in and hurting the overall business model ,-0.26241606660187244,NEGATIVE
Mark Mondello,0.008267490338766947,NEUTRAL
I think it starts with absolute clarity  communication to the troops internally. You know  I can tell you this  I ve been with the company a long time. Right screw things up is when I have stuff in my head with the leadership team and we don t communicate it to the group. What I can tell you and the reciprocal of that is when the group understands where we re going and why we re going there and what our purpose is there s no better team  there just isn t. And so people understand that there s two things that we re focused on for the next two  three  four years  and that s continued expansion of cash flows  and continued expansion and margins. And by the way  our portfolio  we kind of refer to as a portfolio for a reason. We have some business that might be a little softer on the margin side  but based on terms based on the business itself have tremendous cash flows. And we have other businesses that have tremendous margin  but maybe the working capital is a little richer  we have some of that in our healthcare  space and other areas.

And he did a nice job explaining it  but it sounds a little  I don t know  overly technical or whatever. But when we talk about the design side  all the way to repositioning and disposing of older hardware  kind of front to back  I think  Shannon  the solutions we have in that space. Again  it s still what I would call early days  but had been received quite well. And I would also suggest that there is some market share wins in there as well.,0.17444542050361633,POSITIVE

Great  that was helpful. And then my second question is just on stimulus  if you think back to last summer  and maybe what you  I know  it s somewhat hard to determine how much benefit you guys saw directly from stimulus  but how are you thinking about it  when you gave us the guidance for this year in terms of the checks that are going to be hitting in the next few weeks  Thank you.,0.4656528937048279,POSITIVE
Mark Mondello,0.008267490338766947,NEUTRAL
Yes  thanks. Let me break up the back half of     with     and    . I can t make sense of the US equity markets anymore  because I don t know how they got detached from fundamentals in so many ways. I just think that when you put    trillion of stimulus into the system  and there s dollars everywhere  they got to go somewhere. I think that stimulus will be a bit of a driver for the next couple quarters  maybe into  Q of    . But the nice thing is  so as we navigate      I see two things. I see certain parts of our business being driven by what I would call COVID type behaviors  some of those will dissipate  some of those maintain. I see certain parts of our business that are stimulus-related. In certain parts of the United States right now  you go and you try to buy a truck or car  an appliance  whatever it may be  there is backlogs everywhere  and I think that s stimulus related. But as the impact of stimulus  and the impact of COVID start to attenuate a bit and fall off of it  I think what s right behind that is kind of -- no kidding  no nonsense secular trends. And again  Mike talked about it  I talked about it in our prepared remarks  and I think those specific trends certainly will be a driver for our business the next two  three  four years  so it s not like I m sitting here going  geez  when stimulus abates  ph   when COVID types of hardware either go away or reduce -- that there is not going to be other elements that continue to give us a little bit of an uplift. So  I don t know if that helps or gets at your question  but that s how I see it.,-0.0251413956284523,MIXED

Yes  thank you and good morning. Mark  your commentary across end-markets extremely positive  one area that you re still guiding down year-over-year as networking and storage. Looks like you took that up a little bit from   .  billion to   .  billion but still down. Could you tell us what you re seeing in that market  Is there still weakness in on-prim spend and expectations of that improving as the recovery continues post-COVID ,0.31880219280719757,POSITIVE
Mark Mondello,0.008267490338766947,NEUTRAL
Yes  sure. So the network storage business was around   .  billion in fiscal    . September  we took that all the way down to   .  billion  and again  that s a reflection of a couple of things  it s a reflection of some of the legacy business may be starting to lose footing  and lose a little traction out in the marketplace. Number two is  again as we continue to think about our portfolio for fiscal     and      there are certain areas of that business that when we think about our overall invested capital  might not make sense for us any longer but the nice thing is  from the September timeframe to December timeframe  to today  we ve actually been on a trajectory back up. So that s nothing more than  A  we have tremendous relationships with certain customers in that space  and we ll continue to serve those customers  serve them well  and as long as they ll have us  and appreciate the value we provide  we re all in. And -- so I -- again  I think about   .  billion in     to down   .  billion in the last -- I think December  and today we ve taken it back up by      million roughly. And I would just look at -- I d look at network and storage as a -- a very key element of our eight sector makeup. And I would say that even though in some of those businesses  margins might be tight  cash flows are quite good  so it s a very good complement to the other seven sectors.,-0.08794791251420975,NEUTRAL

Mark Mondello,0.008267490338766947,NEUTRAL
Well  won t be much of a growth driver this year. We have to be very  very  very selective in our M A. We are committed to returning capital to shareholders but at the same time  and I made this comment around growth  you know  if we ever get to a point where we re not growing the company  then shame on us  but we have to do so in a margin-friendly cash flow-friendly way  which is I think  what I hope this year s results will start to prove out. And as part of that the good news is  almost all of our material growth is organic which is the best growth to have by two magnitudes  but we will continue to complement that with select M A activity  and for us to put some dollars in play with the acquisition you re talking about is a wonderful company with wonderful people and great leadership  a company called Ecologic. We are very excited about the platform that they ve developed  and we always ask ourselves the question  when we re looking at acquisitions we start with culture alignment  we start with capability and competency  and then what are we going to do with the business when we own it strategically. We have a wonderful roadmap internally around sustainable packaging  and this is kind of a second or third step for us  we believe that we ll be able to take that technology  and as we look towards fiscal      fiscal      give that technology -- it s due in terms of further R D  and then giving that technology exposure to maybe bigger brands that we support based on our balance sheet  our scale and our relationships.,0.036528803408145905,NEUTRAL

Yes  good morning. Thanks very much for taking the questions. The company s doing very well on margins and guiding to  .   for this year  despite what I would think are some temporary cost headwinds related to the supply chain environment  including the shipping cost as the most important component shortages that the whole industry is having to deal with. Can you talk about how much of a headwind the company may be seeing from some of those supply chain types of costs this year  And if we were to add that back  do you think that s more representative of the underlying margin levels that the company can hopefully build off of going forward  Or are there any other temporal factors that we should be thinking about that s influencing margins this year ,0.1828884333372116,POSITIVE
Mark Mondello,0.008267490338766947,NEUTRAL
Thanks  Mark. You know  I -- geez  ph   I said earlier  we ve -- we ve certainly handicapped the business for Q  and Q   and I think our handicap has been appropriate. So I think that in and of itself might suggest that -- you know  if we didn t handicap the business  maybe margins would be  .   for the year  I wouldn t get much ahead of that. But I also mentioned earlier  Mark  the method to our madness in terms of supply chain management  it s wonderful. And just listening to others  either a few customers  suppliers or folks in our industry  we re navigating this thing beautifully  and it s a tough deal but the impact to us  I think will be minimal on a relative basis. And again  as we sit here today  we had a debrief from our entire procurement team last week  and we feel like this thing will start to show levels of relief  as we get into  Q of      and for sure  as we get into calendar     . So to frame out that timeframe  call it September  October  November timeframe  we ll start seeing relief. And then I think things will be back to more normal conditions  call it January  February  March of     .,0.24990210682153702,POSITIVE
With that said  again  we gave the guidance we gave to today for Q  and Q   and I suddenly feel confident.

I think it s a part right  ph  to think that we ll set up automotive factories. The capital intensity  that is enormous  and I don t want our people focused away from what we do really  really well which is sensors  components  sub-assemblies for the entire automotive space  and thank you for the compliment on that  we do have a very good track record in automotive. One of the strategic decisions we made two and a half  three years ago was -- is all hands on in terms of really focusing hard on electrification and EV  not just with automobiles but all the transportation  and I think that -- I think that decision is paying dividends to us. When you think about the term electrification  that would suggest right in our core and the R D dollars and the investments we ve made in that area have been substantial  so I feel pretty good about how we re positioned there  and we ll see how that plays out for     and    . If I had to speculate  make a little bit of a guess today  I think today we look at that the -- the H-sector  ph  chart and -- in FY     automotive transport was about   .  billion  in September we took that up to   .  billion. We re sitting here today saying it will be a bit over   .  billion.

Good morning. I m pleased to be here for my first J.Jill Earnings call. I know that I m joining in an interesting time in the retail industry as we continue to face an uncertain macro environment with some lingering questions around when customers will feel more comfortable going out and shopping in stores. That said  I truly believe in the great opportunity we have here at J.Jill. It s what brought me back to the brand after previously serving as Chief Marketing Officer  almost    years ago. So while I m less than   month into my new role here  I am well  indiscernible  in what makes J.Jill such a special brand and understand the incredible assets we have to leverage  including our brand equity  our strong omni-channel business model  and our incredibly loyal customer base.,0.45925771724432707,POSITIVE

Thank you  Claire. I look forward to our partnership as we position J.Jill for long-term profitable growth. Fiscal year      was a challenging year  and I would like to start today by expressing gratitude to the entire J.Jill team  all of our employees in stores  the distribution center and head offices for the resiliency and tenacity they demonstrated during a time of such great uncertainty. Not only were we focused on navigating the challenging COVID environment  we also took actions to enhance the financial stability of the business  operate more efficiently and position J.Jill for future growth.,0.48035772726871073,POSITIVE
In       we strengthened the balance sheet by extending the maturity on almost     of term loan debt by   years to      by amending debt covenants with lenders  implementing a minimum liquidity covenant and obtaining a leverage covenant holiday through Q  of       amongst other changes and issuing a new subordinated term loan. We took initial steps to improve the operating model  which we will continue to refine by focusing the product assortment and streamlining the number of product flows and adjusting the marketing mix and spend to maximize returns.,0.0382737428881228,NEUTRAL
And finally  to best position ourselves for fiscal       we took decisive actions  including a comprehensive review of the store fleet in light of the uncleared time line to recovery of store traffic due to the COVID pandemic and made the decision to close    stores. And we executed on our commitment to aggressively manage inventories in fiscal      to provide a clean start to     . Looking at the fourth quarter  we continue to see signs of progress. Top line sales of      million improved sequentially compared to the third quarter  and each month within the quarter improved sequentially as well. While store traffic continued to trend meaningfully below prior year in the fourth quarter  with enclosed mall stores trailing lifestyle centers  customers that did cross the threshold converted better and responded well to full-priced product.,0.1628278992138803,NEUTRAL
Direct sales were     of total  driven in part by lower store sales but also by positive customer response to new full price collections online. Gross margin of   .   includes     basis points related to aggressive action taken in the quarter to liquidate liable markdown products through third parties. Excluding the impact of these liquidations  gross margin was   .    up compared to last year  driven by the strength in full price selling. We continue to focus on operating the business more efficiently. SG A expenses were down     million compared to last year  driven by reductions in store-related selling costs and lower marketing spend.,0.05506729753687978,NEUTRAL
Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the year with inventories down     compared to last year. Total liquidity  as defined in our covenant terms  measured as ending cash balance plus check float and ABL availability was    .  million as of the end of the fourth quarter  down compared to third quarter due to the normal cadence of cash usage this time of the year. Regarding tax  the CARES Act passed in March of      permits tax losses to be carried back to recover taxes paid in prior years. We are currently preparing the required filings to obtain refunds by carrying back our current year tax loss and expect to receive a tax refund in excess of     million. Consistent with our debt agreements  we expect to apply these     million of this refund to pay down the priming term loan by August         .,-0.06569261709228158,NEUTRAL
Looking at fiscal       we continue to focus on strengthening the foundation of the business. With visibility still low given the ongoing pandemic  we are not providing guidance at this time. We do  however  expect revenues to continue to recover in the first half as we anniversary temporary store closures related to the COVID-   shutdowns in     . We continue to focus on driving gross margin improvement supported by reduced inventory levels and better full price selling. Capital investment will increase to approximately     million  driven by a return to normalized capital maintenance levels and select investments in customer experience enhancing initiatives. And though we believe the store channel is a very important channel for J.Jill  we will continue to evaluate store performance post-pandemic and expect to close about    stores in     .,0.03373381681740284,NEUTRAL

We are thrilled with our progress in the fourth quarter and in      in general. We made excellent headway across our pipeline  including the initiation of the pivotal study for tirnovetmab and positive results on our inflammatory bowel disease program.,0.49853305340366205,POSITIVE

Let me start with an update on our dermatitis franchise. We initiated the pivotal study for tirnovetmab in December of last year. It s too soon to tell how quickly it will enroll and our expectation that the study will take    to    months to complete hasn t changed. This is one of our flagship product candidates. And given that the canine dermatitis market has grown to nearly    billion a year  we would expect tirnovetmab to be extremely successful.,0.18394132610410452,NEUTRAL
In addition  we are advancing our other candidates for dermatitis nicely  including our IL-  receptor antibody. As a reminder  IL-  our antibody targets the underlying disease itself instead of just the symptoms. So it could potentially have significant advantages over certain available therapies.,0.12055260455235839,NEUTRAL
We believe we have one of the broadest and most advanced dermatitis pipelines in the industry  including several molecules that have not had been disclosed. We have already incorporated our Half Life Extension technology into our dermatitis pipeline  and think long-acting molecules have the potential to be best-in-class and possibly market leaders.,0.12882181687746197,NEUTRAL

Turning to the parvovirus program  we have reported compelling results from the prophylaxis pivotal study. The treatment pivotal study has been delayed longer than expected  but we expect results in the near future. We believe that this antibody has the potential to revolutionize the care of dogs and puppies with this devastating condition. There s a lot of excitement both within the company and outside about this program  which offers hope for what is a terrible and currently untreatable disease.,0.10873304260894656,MIXED
We re very excited about our partnership with Elanco  which has one of the best commercial organizations in the industry. The terms of the partnership are very favorable  with milestones totaling over      million  as we previously announced. We also read out the results for the inflammatory bowel disease program at the end of last year  and the results were impressive.,0.4960967636325222,POSITIVE
Complete remission was achieved in     of the TNF antibody group  compared to     in the placebo group.

Furthermore      of the treated dogs achieved and maintain      reduction of disease score from baseline throughout all posts dose visits  whereas none of the placebo group achieved the same result,0.16179998591542244,NEUTRAL
IBD and related disorders are very common  affecting over    of dogs. The market has many similarities to the atopic dermatitis market  before modern treatments are approved  including notable impact on the owners quality of life.

But can you detail on what looks like maybe nine  you know three additional quarters or nine additional months of the company being fully funded  And maybe it s from that Vaxart.

Okay. And last one from me  and then I ll follow-up offline. I believe Richard  when you were talking about  IBD  you mentioned  increased conviction that the market size could maybe even be as big as atopic derm. I mean atopic derm  is obviously one of the - the bigger success stories that we ve had in the companion animal market. Can you talk to what  led you down that path and mentioned that  And why the increase conviction  if you would  that IBD could be such a material blockbuster  Thank you.,0.1831219717860222,POSITIVE
Richard Chin,-0.00028001985629089177,NEUTRAL
Absolutely  so obviously  we ve been talking to additional veterinarians and customers. And as we ve been analyzed the data we ve realized  how impressive the data is. So if you look at the market  so atopic dermatitis is about - affects about     of dogs  inflammatory bowel disease  and diseases that are sort of in that similar category affects at least    or probably more than    of the dog.,0.08613986521959305,POSITIVE
We think the impact on the quality of life is actually more significant for inflammatory bowel disease  because the dog is basically making a mess on the carpet.

Right now  the mainstay is steroids  which is cheap  but has a lot of side effects  including making the dog pee on the carpet  and they become incontinent.,-0.061973683536052704,MIXED
And just like the atopic dermatitis market before the current therapies were launched  the veterinarians and owners had to make do with therapies that were either not effective or has a lot of side effects  the exact same situation in the case in IBD. So  if we bring out a drug that has similar well  that works quickly that works well.,0.020083043724298477,NEUTRAL

I m curious Richard  if you would mind talking just a little bit about your sort of philosophy  as it relates to some of these next generations  next in the product line in the pipeline products in terms of partnering  Are you thinking A  that you want to pursue partnerships for these additional indications are you thinking it s more likely that you would continue to work with Elanco or do you think it might make sense to work with a variety of potential partners as you move those products forward ,0.010135630145668983,NEUTRAL
Richard Chin,-0.00028001985629089177,NEUTRAL
Yes  so Elanco has been a great partner so far. We re working really well with them. So I could certainly envision partnering on other products with them. We do plan on partnering most of our products. And depending on the product  we may partner earlier or later  I think some products  the value is so apparent  early in the development that we could get attractive economics for those  some of the other ones  we may need to wait a little longer.,0.49261719826608896,POSITIVE
So it will be on a case-by-case basis as to when we partner to depend on when we think we can get the best economics. Now I think what you re alluding to is  do we plan on having a multiproduct partnership with other companies. We haven t approach about partnerships like that. Right now  we are focused on individual products  but certainly it all depends on the terms. So  we wouldn t rule that out.,0.05233161896467209,NEUTRAL

Maybe I ll start the answer and Wendy feel free to add to it. Certainly  we expect additional revenues from partnerships  both milestones  and royalties. We expect to continue to build our contract manufacturing business  which as I said  is not our primary line of work. But right now we re in the fortunate situation that there s a lot of demand for biologics.

And that s different than manufacturing for FDA or EMA.,0.20391300157643855,NEUTRAL

Hi  thanks for taking my question and congratulations on all the progress during year. Maybe just one from me on KIND-    and but the indication they re being pursued the prophylactic and therapeutic. If the therapeutic pivotal efficacy is successful  when you could elaborate on their regulatory strategy there  is this a label expansion post approval of the prophylactic an amendment to the current submission or completely different filing altogether  Thank you.,0.4655337631702423,POSITIVE
Richard Chin,-0.00028001985629089177,NEUTRAL
Sure. If the treatment study is not positive for some reason  and obviously  there s always some risk whenever you re doing clinical studies. We would launch with the prophylaxis indication or Elanco would. And the advantage of this molecule is that it s the same presentation  its same bio  which means that veterinarians would be free to use the drug for either indication. We would follow that up with a second approval.,-0.01205490529537201,NEUTRAL
Because even if  for some reason one is trouble with the study  we would certainly repeat it because we know the molecule works for treatment. So I would anticipate the sales would still be quite attractive  because veterinarian s most likely use the drug for both indications obviously  we would not be promoting for an unapproved use. So I think under that scenario  there would be some impact. But the impact would not be - may not be as great as you might otherwise think on revenues.,-0.12300873827189207,MIXED

Richard Chin,-0.00028001985629089177,NEUTRAL
Yes  the clinical filing would be separate. But the manufacturing  part of the filing would be shared between the two. And manufacturing right now is the rate limiting factor. So even with the delay in the treatment pivotal  we don t anticipate the approval date will be affected. Because the part that we think is going to be the regular limiting factor is the speed at which USDA is able to test the manufacturing samples we send them.,-0.1786633743904531,NEUTRAL
So USDA takes the bios from your manufacturing run  and they run their own tests on those samples. And from what we ve heard  there s a delay  it s taking them longer than it normally does  because they re short staffed  most likely due to COVID.,-0.292290726210922,NEGATIVE

As previously mentioned  in the third quarter  the company discovered efficiencies and controls required to safeguard its assets. The company determined that controls were inadequate with regard to the timely input and verification of master data updates for equity grants and  therefore  resulted in the detection of errors or misstatements in employee equity account balances. This control weakness did not result in the misstatement of any current or prior period financial statements. The company has remediated these control deficiencies as of December         . Documentation and supervisory review controls around master data were strengthened  and an audit trail of stock-based compensation award additions and modifications performed by the service provider is now being maintained.

Thank you  Julia. Good morning and good afternoon  and thank you for joining us today. In       we delivered one of the most successful years in the company s history. It was truly a transformational year  with the accelerated approval of Monjuvi  as the first and only second-line treatment for patients with relapsed refractory diffuse large B cell lymphoma who are not eligible for stem cell transplant. We are incredibly proud of this achievement. As this is just the beginning and we are looking forward to building momentum over time. We believe tafasitamab has the potential to transform the standard of care in DLBCL  and will lead to a paradigm shift in how patients will B cell malignancies are treated.,0.49748181366885547,POSITIVE
We are looking to rapidly expand the tafasitamab opportunity through label expansion and exploring tafasitamab in combination with other approved or emerging compounds. The execution in brining this important breakthrough therapy to the market for patients has created a strong foundation for MorphoSys as in integrated commercial biopharmaceutical company. Throughout the year  we continue to progress and expand our pipeline in the areas of hematology  oncology  and autoimmune diseases. We presented very encouraging preliminary Phase  b data from our first-line study in first-line DLBCL that paves the way to initiate our pivotal front-line study in the coming months.,0.1419933285069419,NEUTRAL
Turning to business development activities  at the start of       we entered into an important global commercial and development partnership with Incyte  for tafasitamab. We are excited that we entered into a development collaboration with Xencor to evaluate the combination of tafasitamab with Xencor s bispecific CD  xCD  antibody  plamotamab  aiming to help more patients with certain non-Hodgkin lymphoma. And shifting gears to our financials for the year  we reported very solid results  with revenue of roughly      million  and EBIT     million. Revenue in part included    .  million from the product sales of Monjuvi. We also significantly strengthened our balance sheet  and we have completed all of this in the middle of the global pandemic.,0.15931585767975776,NEUTRAL
Moving to slide six  our business model currently represents three pillars guiding future value creation. The first pillar will drive value from our own commercialization efforts. We were excited to start booking U.S. sales for Monjuvi in the third quarter of     . We see great potential to expand its use by becoming a standard of care and a backbone in NHL  which will derive increased commercial opportunities. Another asset I would like to highlight in this pillar is felzartamab. It could become an attractive opportunity as a treatment for select autoimmune diseases where the unmet medical disease is high  starting with autoimmune membranous nephropathy.,0.2573246837418992,POSITIVE
Our second value drivers are royalties and milestones from our partnered and out-licensed programs. Our program with Janssen  Tremfya  is approved for  psoriasis   Ph  and psoriatic arthritis in the U.S.  EU  and other countries. We are very pleased with the commercial success of Tremfya  and look forward to Janssen developing Tremfya for use in additional indications. Other late-stage partnered programs include GSK s otilimab for rheumatoid arthritis  and COVID-related severe respiratory distress syndrome  as well as Roche s gantenerumab for Alzheimer s disease. And the third value driver is our research platform that has been the foundation for MorphoSys  success with cutting-edge antibody technologies.,0.2972965268418193,POSITIVE
We are continually enriching it with next-generation platforms to drive further groundbreaking innovation. In November  we signed a license agreement with Cherry Biolabs for a potentially exciting next-generation Hemibody technology. We believe these three pillars will driver shareholder value.,0.3697832610923797,POSITIVE
Moving to slide seven  our top priority is the continued execution of the Monjuvi launch  where we are very encouraged by the early progress. We continue to get positive feedback from physicians  and have maintained leading share of voice of approximately    . We anticipate the potential for viability for the first two-year of launch during the global pandemic  but we are confident in the long-term trajectory for Monjuvi.,0.31112697678327095,POSITIVE
And beyond our current second-line indication  we are rapidly expanding tafasitamab in additional hematologic oncology indications  and are planning the initiation of two pivotal trials in the first-half of this year  including the initiation of a pivotal trial in first-line DLBCL called FontMIND in the coming month. The second pivotal trial called L-MIND for follicular lymphoma  and marginal zone lymphoma is set to start soon. The follicular lymphoma indication received orphan designation in January of this year. With tafasitamab s differentiated profile  it has the potential to be a partner of choice. As I mentioned earlier  we are also advancing other pipeline assets  including tafasitamab  where we expect to get proof-of-concept data in the coming month.,0.016186072549317032,NEUTRAL
And finally  our disciplined capital allocation strategy is an important component as we focus on balancing investments in our internal pipeline along with potential external opportunities that are a strategic fit.      was a year marked by many important accomplishments  encouraged by the approval of Monjuvi.

Thank you  Jean-Paul  and hello everyone. Moving to slide nine       was indeed an exciting year for us  and one of our defining moments was the accelerated approval of Monjuvi in late July. From FDA approval through the end of December  we delivered on a rapid speed to market  achieving major launch milestones within days of approval. In fact  the first Monjuvi order  shipment  patient dose  and inclusion in NCCN guidelines all happened within the first    days following approval. We ensured rapid and robust payer access  and coverage for Monjuvi through commercial and government channels is well-established.,0.43891537716262974,POSITIVE
Now  taking a closer look at Q   the first book order for Monjuvi in the marketplace  we reported     million in sales for the quarter and     million for the year. Q  Monjuvi sales were primarily driven by demand and also benefited from a third-party clinical trial supply order and some select NGOs inventory buying at the close of the year. The latter two factors contributed about    million in Monjuvi sales in Q .,0.022221422754228115,NEUTRAL
Moving to slide     we were very encouraged by the continued traction we saw in the number of accounts ordering Monjuvi. During our last call  we shared that more than     sites of care had ordered by the end of October with     reordering. By the end of December  we saw a significant increase with cumulative orders from more than     sites since launch. Key academic centers continue to be strongly interested in Monjuvi  and we are seeing increased momentum in community care indicating the broad accessibility of Monjuvi for patients in both academic and community settings. Given that we are already quite advanced in first quarter  we want to share some reflections on the start of the year. After strong momentum in      and while uptake in second line continues to increase  we saw the first months of      impacted by two factors.,0.42714910049107857,POSITIVE
First  the unprecedented surge in the COVID pandemic after the holidays impacted sites of care across the U.S. and limited our ability to see physicians. While they continue to maintain a leading share of voice of about     and see continued interest in our messages  the COVID surge slowed down our engagement of key physicians. Second  as a result of the winter storms across the U.S. in February  we expect some patients in their early cycles have their treatment temporarily interrupted. These factors may impact our Q  results. However  we are seeing treatment levels in the last few weeks return to the momentum we built at the end of     .

Our focus in      is to lay the foundation for long-term growth. We expect the gradual build from Monjuvi as we drive increased uptake in second-line  and as patients who respond to continue treatment to progression over time. Monjuvi safe and tolerability profile together with its duration of response  support the paradigm shift in the treatment of relapsed refractory DLBCL. Our treatment regimen to treat patients with Monjuvi to progression makes the two year long-term data relevant not only for patient benefit  but also from a business perspective.

Thank you  Roland. As Jean-Paul and Roland have mentioned  we are very proud of all our accomplishments in       highlighted by the U.S. approval of Monjuvi. We have achieved FDA approval with an innovative approach in record time with a second-line labor  which is the foundation of making Monjuvi available for many patients suffering from relapsed refractory DLBCL.,0.48653044613456586,POSITIVE
I would now like to concentrate on the outlook for this year     . And let me start with tafasitamab.

Regarding the evolving L-MIND data  the durability of responses is an important differentiator for patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL treated with Monjuvi in combination with lenalidomide. Data from the two-year cut off showed a median duration of response of close to three years  along with a median overall survival of   .  months. Patients in this study who achieved a complete response  have a greater than     chance to remain in complete remission after two years and a greater than     chance to be alive after two years.,0.025523208896629512,NEUTRAL
This benefit was especially pronounced for patients who are treated with Monjuvi and lenalidomide as a second-line treatment. In these patients  we could observe an overall response rate of   .   as well as a    months overall survival rate of   .  . These data combined with Monjuvi safety and tolerability profile support a paradigm shift for traditionally difficult to treat patients  potentially offering long-term disease control. We are looking forward to the next three-year cut off  and we are confident that we will be able to provide further evidence supporting Monjuvi s duration of response. This data will be presented at one of the upcoming medical conferences.,0.07339113089255989,NEUTRAL
Beyond relapsed refractory DLBCL our focus is on the rapid expansion of the clinical development of tafasitamab into earlier lines of treatment as well as into additional indications. It is our aim to develop tafasitamab as the backbone treatment for patients with DLBCL and other B-cell hematological malignancies. We have started to investigate tafasitamab and lenalidomide in first-line DLBCL with the aim to improve cure rates and to create a new standard of care regimen. There s a high unmet needs for DLBCL patients in the first-line setting  especially those at high-risk with an IPI score of three to five.

The First-MIND data are the basis for our Phase   study  frontMIND  and we are on track to start this study soon. frontMIND will enroll up to     patients and will evaluate the tafasitamab lenalidomide combination in addition to R-CHOP compared to R-CHOP alone. We believe we can make a difference by adding this potent synergistic combination starting treatment promptly within    days and focusing on high risk patients. Our ambition is to improve cure rates in DLBCL in all treatment lines. Beyond DLBCL  we will expand the use of tafasitamab into other indications and plan to start a pivotal study in indolent lymphoma  another area with high unmet needs  particularly for high risk patients.

Geoffrey Porges,-0.012838608119636774,NEUTRAL
Thank you very much. Appreciate the questions and the clarity. So  a couple for Sung  if we could  on the guidance  so first  dumb question  but is your operating expense guidance including cost of goods. Secondly  is your gross margin profile for Q  likely to be where you will be going forward  And then  just in terms of your SG A  it implies that your SG A is roughly going to be flat at the fourth quarter level  I believe. So I just want to clarify that. And then lastly  if you do secure approval in the EU for Monjuvi  would you expect there to be a milestone payment  Thank you.,0.29109015269204974,POSITIVE
Sung Lee,0.0022144888062030077,NEUTRAL
Great. Geoff  thanks for all those questions. And please remind me if I have skipped one. But your first question  about COG  that is not part of our operating expense. So just to be clear  operating expense is R D and SG A expenses. In terms of gross margin percent  I think this will be relatively stable as we re exiting last year. We don t see that much variability this year. And I can even provide some additional color on that. For this year  you can expect it to be in the mid-to-high   s  okay. And that s product gross margin. In terms of sales expenses or SG A  you had mentioned that Q  -- could we expect it to be basically the run rate of Q . I think you re thinking about it the right way.,0.29797275364398956,POSITIVE
And basically  as the increase in SG A is largely driven by the full-year impact of the Monjuvi selling expenses. And these were not built at the same time in     . So  there s a staggering effect in      and we just expect to see the full-year impact of that. And then in terms of milestones  for the potential approval of Monjuvi in the EU  I think is a very important question  and I d like to make this very clear. That event  of potential approval of Monjuvi in the EU  does not trigger any milestone payments to MorphoSys. Further to that  the initiation of the front-line study for first-line DLBCL  that also would not trigger a milestone to MorphoSys.,-0.16359604988247156,NEGATIVE
And just to wrap up the response  I think the last two points  the milestones.

James Gordon,0.00019304247689433396,NEUTRAL
Hello  James Gordon  JPMorgan. Thanks for taking the questions. The first one just on Monjuvi and the     implied U.S. revenue outlook. Since the guidance  if I understand it right  seems to imply that Monjuvi should do something like     million to      million for the year  and the bottom end of that seems to be only about     above annualizing what you already did in Q . So  there are two questions. One is  heard the comments on Q  headwind  do you actually think Q  is going to see any growth on Q  or could Q  even be flat or down based on what you re seeing ,-0.030099406838417053,NEUTRAL
I heard comments on COVID and winter storm. And for the full-year  what are you assuming about how long COVID headwinds persist for  do you think things are going to get a lot better in the second-half  or is the guidance assuming things as bad for COVID as is Q  for the whole year  And more longer-term on Monjuvi  so I know there was a guidance before  that Monjuvi was going to hit a peak in the U.S. in refractory patients with      million to      million. I didn t see that side on the slide. So  is that being reiterated today or are you being a bit more cautious there for various reasons  including maybe competition from CD   CD  s  or anything else ,-0.2678685374557972,NEGATIVE
And then just the second question would be Polivy and the Polaris first-line data coming up from Roche. So  in the event that we do get positive data there over the next few months in front-line DLBCL  what do you think that means for Monjuvi  Does that reduce the opportunity in refractory patients at all  Any thoughts like what that could mean  please ,-0.1317916177213192,NEUTRAL
Jean-Paul Kress,-8.817696652840823e-05,NEUTRAL
So  James  thanks for your question. This is Jean-Paul. I ll address two and three  and Roland will come back to the Monjuvi      sales. Regarding peak sales  the      million to      million you re mentioning is still our assumption. And  of course  putting some caveats on potential market share and mark evolution  this is what we have in mind now. And also  bear in mind  this is for the current indication in the United States. So  if you count on potential other territories  we should be north of   billion for this indication. And obviously  this doesn t include potential line extensions  other indications  and potential combinations  because  as we stated a couple of times  really important to keep in mind that part of the great potential of Monjuvi  as we see it  is the backbone strategy when we will combine with other modalities  starting with  Len   Ph  obviously  but also with the Xencor bispecific  and potentially other modalities and compounds. In terms of your question on another event for first-line  we don t really comment on competition.,0.058650366961956024,NEUTRAL
That being said  obviously  we watch this space very closely. And we are extremely confident in our approach for first-line based on the strengths of our regimen  probably the efficacy durability combined with our safety and convenience make us very confident that we can be a key player in first-line regardless of other events. And again  this is good news for the patients  that there will be a couple of regimen in this indication. And last  but not least  it speaks to the size of the opportunity in first-line. Bear in mind that there is        new U.S. patients every year in first-line  so no wonder why there are a couple of companies trying to cut the cord here. But again  we remain very  very confident in our approach.,0.45969521056395024,POSITIVE

Yes  thank you  James. Speaking about Q   our quarter of course still ongoing and we look forward to sharing the results for Q  shortly. We just thought that  given that we re quite forward into the quarter already  it was worth to give a heads-up regarding COVID impact and winter storm  and also to share the continued positive feedback that we re hearing from prescribers around the profile for Monjuvi  and especially those prescribers that have seen our long-term data  at ASH  for second-line patients  how intrigued they are with the duration of response.,0.46752388749155216,POSITIVE
Looking at the rest of this year  and at COVID  with vaccinations hopefully gaining more traction as we move forward  our team is prepared to engage healthcare professionals increasingly in person from the middle of this year  which will be important  especially with the new data that we look forward to sharing at medical conferences  in summer. And as you think about the uptake of Monjuvi  as we said before  expect a gradual build. We spoke about the        patients in the U.S.  therefore        in second-line  where we re the only ones that are approved. We are looking at an increase uptake in those second-line patients. And also  as we continue to have traction in second-line  we expect that the average duration of response  which of course is shorter in late-line patients  will continue to build over time.

My second question just is on the OpEx guidance for the year  and I just want to make sure that I m not missing anything. I believe that the fourth quarter OpEx was about      million in total OpEx  and -- but the guidance for the year is      million to      million  so just wondering if you could reconcile if you annualize fourth quarter over      million  and so I just wanted to maybe get some more clarity as to how we should be thinking about SG A and R D. So that s my second question. And then my third question just has to do with felzartamab and the data that we re expecting.

Okay  great  thanks Jean-Paul. And appreciate the question. With regard to your question on the consensus Monjuvi estimates out there  obviously we come out with guidance. And obviously  there has been a reaction. And I ve seen many follow-up or notes written with new ranges. I ll just simply refer you to slide     because I think we ve laid out the revenue guidance there pretty well  where you can back into a reasonable range. For instance  the low end of our range       million  the high end       million  we have stated that this is inclusive of the     million milestone that was triggered for otilimab from GSK. We have also said that we expect moderate year-over-year growth for Tremfya. And  of course  lots here  the royalties here    .  million. So  we expect again  moderate growth.,0.3340105996467173,POSITIVE
The range does not include any other significant milestones. And as I mentioned in my first response to Geoff s question  we are not expecting any outside milestone for EU approval or the initiation of the front-line study. Now  with all those components given  I think you can reasonably get to a range. And I would say  this range  we re very comfortable with. Given  in the backdrop of COVID  we have to make sure that we accounted for a situation that persists into the second-half. And also  you have the first year of launch of Monjuvi  which comes with its own variability. So  this is a range we re comfortable with.,0.3664690814912319,POSITIVE
With regard to your question on OpEx and the reconciliation of the Q  as a proxy  Q  operating expense was just shy of      million. There are some one-timers in there. So  if you back those out  that s basically how you get to a lower operating expense  vis- -vis a run rate from Q . So  I hope that gives you some additional color.,-0.03579217940568924,NEUTRAL

Hello  thank you for taking my questions. I ve got three  please. So on the frontMIND  you mentioned the study starts in the next couple of months  but we ve known the study design for quite a while since then  back into last year at your Monjuvi experts  when can we expect to start the drug start  if any delay purely down to COVID  And the Polarex trial you re going to be reading out in the next couple of months as well. So  are you potentially looking for  or waiting to look at what could happen there could be design of frontMIND change with the results of Polarex  that s number one. Number two  on the milestones for Monjuvi  could you give us an idea of what could you get the milestones  so it sounds like there s not a lot coming in       Are the milestones  are the regulatory milestones  are they pretty much attached to approvals in front-line DLBCL   indiscernible  and other indications. And thirdly  on your backbone strategy for Monjuvi  since obviously the Incyte deal and the Xencor deal there hadn t been a lot of activity in terms of combinations  you mentioned carry.

And we re really encouraged by our preliminary data of firstMIND  which we have shot at ASH with an overall response rate of over    . And lastly  currently  we re the only meaningful Phase   study in front-line DLBCL. So we expect actually a very high degree of excitement regarding our frontMIND program.,0.4813274077314418,POSITIVE

Okay  good. So  let me take that as well. Again  we re really proud and also excited about the interactions  we have made with Xencor and also with other companies regarding new and exciting combination programs  including CD  CD  assets. The reason we started actually with Xencor was that we know Xencor very well  we have a very good and long standing and trustworthy relationship. And we re now in the process of evaluating other potential combination partners. And we take this one step at a time  a basket trial would be probably difficult because the other agents that you have mentioned are not yet approved. That s why we will probably look at collaboration agreements with other companies if the opportunities arise.,0.1770085021853447,MIXED

Thanks  Malte. Okay  with regard to your question on milestones for Tafa  recall when we did this deal  it included a large upfront  along with the eligibility of   .  billion for regulatory and commercial milestones. And I just called out two that are not included of that   .  billion. To the extent that we enter a year and a milestone is significant for that year  we could talk about these because obviously  it would be material to our company in that year  but just wanting to respect the confidentiality of our agreement with our partner  I m going to have to leave the details for the appropriate time.

Vineet Agrawal,0.3684082026593387,POSITIVE
Yes  hi. Thanks for taking my questions. Three please. So first is the clarification on OpEx. So  I think on slide     we can see that the OpEx of     .  million for      includes COGS of about    million  but you re saying that is excluded from      guidance. So just wanted to confirm if you re changing the way you define OpEx and then second on R D  Incyte has disclosed     million costs related to Monjuvi development for     . And obviously  that s the     share  but is it for full-year or it s from the date the deal got completed that is sometime in March. And the last question is on your last slide  you didn t include the Xencor royalty  if you could just clarify where it sits within the Monjuvi P L ,0.02054687961935997,NEUTRAL
Sung Lee,0.0022144888062030077,NEUTRAL
Sure. So  this is Sung  yes  that s a very astute observation on OpEx. So the classical definition of that I ll just define OpEx with its R D expense and SG A expense. And I provided separate color on cost of goods sold  or gross margin I should say  with regard to Monjuvi. So it s separated. So  I can confirm that. OpEx again  does not include any elements of cost of goods sold or cost of sales. Okay  with regard to your question on the Tafa R D  I think you were talking about reimbursement the       split  where we pick up     of the development expenses and Incyte balance. I ll have to double-check this  but I believe this formula applies retroactively to a time that s before the effective date of the agreement. But I d like to be able to verify that and follow-up with you. And then your last question with regard to the Xencor royalties. And please correct me if I got the incorrect understanding. But basically  there are royalties due to Xencor on worldwide sales. However  with regard to U.S. Monjuvi sales  the Xencor royalties factored into the profit share  okay  Ex-U.S.  MorphoSys is responsible for paying the royalty to Xencor from the royalties that we received from Incyte.,-0.08750289864838123,NEUTRAL

Yes  the development strategy of conducting  scheduling  finding or defining studies in parallel to the sort of proof of concept study is actually quite normal in the autoimmune development worlds. So  we are on purpose doing this in parallel  so that we not only get confidence on the activity of this program in a significant autoimmune indication  but at the same time develop the best schedule going forward. And as its public information  you can see it in    for  .

Yes. On Monjuvi  real-world usage as you would expect in any launch in hematology  there are physicians that are having an initial trial of the medicine for later line  the last line patients that have run out of options. We ve seen this happening. Having said that  over these last months  we are very encouraged  pleased with the uptake that we see in second-line  where we are the only approved regimen for patients and especially in the community setting that offers a very attractive opportunity for patients and for healthcare professional. So  we re very pleased with what we re seeing in terms of the transition going into second-line  where we also expect treatment durations to be longer in line with the long-term data that we are sharing. As for the usage before and after  CAR-T   Ph  I think that Malte perhaps give us a bit more color and share with more color there.,0.4731817619758658,POSITIVE

Yes  thanks  Roland. So  we actually see both. We actually see Monjuvi used before and after CAR-T treatment  which I think also make sense from a scientific and clinical data perspective. We have -- we are in the process of also sharing data regarding the CD   expression. So that we can gain confidence inside and also outside that the CD   target actually remains intact upon longer-term treatment with Monjuvi.

One further clarification question on the guidance  and so  is with any Monjuvi revenue coming out of Europe also in form as a loyalty included in this guidance at all. And that would be my first question. And the second question is on Monjuvi market launch in U.S. Is it fair to assume that I interpret your comments with regards to the impact of the Corona as well as the winter storms in U.S. that  that March  April  maybe also May might also be more complicated quarters in terms of the launch. And that s my second question. And my last question on Tremfya royalties and then the moderate year-on-year growth you have included in your guidance for     . And the product was also approved in Europe for psoriatic arthritis. Is that now a more normal growth rate or the status of that product or why is that not stronger  Thank you.,0.08152208290994167,NEUTRAL

Thank you  Daniel. I ll take question two on the Monjuvi launch. Look  as we said several times during the COVID at early days  and we launched in the middle of the pandemic. So we ve focusing on execution on the launch  but I mean  bearing in mind that we are so focused also on and looking the long-term potential of Monjuvi. And you wanted a couple of examples this morning with  indiscernible . We have so many opportunities with the pipeline  Monjuvi as a backbone  Monjuvi as a  indiscernible  product  felzartamab  earlier R D and obviously potential external of proximity.

Right. So  I think your first question was  have we baked in any royalty revenue from potential EU sales of Monjuvi  and the answer is simply is no. Obviously when that event happens we ll have greater certainty. Your other question was with regard to Tremfya growth  and I just referring slide    where we ve characterized it as we expect moderate growth. And I think your question is why not more. Well  simply I think definitions of moderate vary  but certainly this is not something we want to be aggressive on because we receive as much information as you do with regard to Tremfya sales up there. And obviously  in      it did   .  billion  so it s blockbuster status. The year before     billion  and it seems like with the amount of studies our partner is conducting and the footprint expansion for Tremfya  this continues to have a runway. But it s certainly is not something we have tremendous visibility into. And again  we do not receive any detailed forecast from our partner.

Malte Peters,-0.006043071276508272,NEUTRAL
So  let me start with the first question on M-PLACE. Yes  we are of course monitoring the autoantibody titers in conjunction with Proteinuria data. And as you may know  the Proteinuria data come roughly six to nine months after you see the first drop in autoantibody titers  that s just by normal process of how kidney reacts to the disappearance of the pathogenic autoantibody. So that s why we hope to have as many data for Proteinuria as possible. But we certainly have immunological data and for proportion of patients for sure are supported by Proteinuria data. With respect to the comparison or benchmarking too  we took them up that s actually quite difficult to make sort of a cross product comparison because recall that in our trail -- in the M-PLACE trial  a significant focus is on patients who would have almost zero probability to respond to tafasitamab because they have such high autoantibody titer. So  that s a difficult situation to give a good benchmarking comparison. But I think with respect to the anecdotal information we receive from other anti-CD   antibodies in similar diseases and with respect to what we have seen in our multiple myeloma studies regarding autoantibody production  antibody production  we are really confident and optimistic that we actually score extremely high and have a very competitive product.,-0.020313418470323086,NEUTRAL

In both instances the customer made a commitment to minimum quarterly purchases for our Pure-Vu sleeves and for doing so  we are allowing the early adopters what we are calling centers of excellence to utilize our capital equipment at no additional cost  while these minimums are met or exceeded. We believe deploying this razor blade model works well in instances where capital funding is currently unavailable  as it permit the customer to expand use of the Pure-Vu system  while providing us with more predictable sleeve volumes.,0.07587900286307558,NEUTRAL
Given the current capital environment  we expect to complete additional agreements like these with early adopter hospitals in the first half of the year. You may also recall that University of Texas and NYU are two locations that have implemented a protocol that identifies clear clinical circumstances where the Pure-Vu system should be utilized  which is also resulting in more consistent usage patterns. Replicating similar patient identification protocols in additional Pure-Vu site  is a key focus for our commercial team.,0.018472136463969946,NEUTRAL
In the fourth quarter we also expanded our business by initiating product evaluations at new accounts  most notably the Mayo Clinic in Phoenix and Mass General Hospital in Boston. While we may not see the current environment begin to normalize immediately  we believe as hospital access returns and GI procedures rebound to pre-pandemic levels  we are poised to drive an acceleration of Pure-Vu utilization.,0.004143671598285437,NEUTRAL
Due to the pandemic  we ve yet to benefit from having all of our hospitals fully up and running at any one time over the past year. As part of our fiscal discipline  we are currently fielding a small customer facing team. This team is doing a great job driving the result that I summarized  and as we see a more favorable environment emerge  we will look to thoughtfully invest in expanding our commercial organization with the goal of driving faster utilization and revenue growth.,0.3003951254358981,POSITIVE
I want to switch gears to upcoming catalysts for the business. We have identified four value creation drivers that we believe have the potential to meaningfully enhance and accelerate our business in      and beyond. They are reimbursement  product innovation  clinical data and strategic partnerships.,0.1111483653075993,NEUTRAL
Let me start with reimbursement. In the back half of       we began to develop a comprehensive strategy aimed at positioning Pure-Vu for reimbursement coverage in both the in-patient and the out-patient settings. While there are many pathways to achieve both public and private coverage  we are initially focused on CMS programs designed to provide payment for new and unique technologies.,0.020397400949150324,NEUTRAL
In the fourth quarter we submitted an application to CMS for a new technology add-on payment  sometimes referred to NTAP. This program could provide reimbursement for Pure-Vu during in-patient colonoscopy. As part of this submission  we also applied for an ICD-   code. As you may have seen in a recent press release  on March   we participated in CMS s Coordination Meeting where I am pleased to share that they recommended Pure-Vu to be considered for an ICD-   code.,0.02857054481864907,NEUTRAL
CMS is now conducting an open comment period and then the final decision will be made through a subsequent clearing process. If a code is awarded and substantively NTAP coverage  we believe adoption and utilization of Pure-Vu in the in-patient market can be accelerated.,0.020692257821792737,NEUTRAL
We also submitted an application for CMS s transitional pass-through payment. This program could provide reimbursement for traditional outpatient procedures. We believe high medical need patience that can t successfully complete their pre-procedural bowl prep would benefit greatly from Pure-Vu.,0.09633764205500484,NEUTRAL
Securing pass-through coverage for our system could be a significant catalyst for our business  as it would provide economic incentives for physicians to use Pure-Vu on the roughly   million high medical need procedures each year in the U.S. It would also mark our first entry into the large out-patient market.,0.11180543317459524,NEUTRAL
Next  I d like to discuss new product innovation. I am pleased to report that our product development efforts to launch our first Pure-Vu system for use in Upper GI endoscopy is on track and we expect to submit a    -K application to the FDA by early Q . This would potentially position us with an approved and available product on the market by early Q .,0.1976047281641513,NEUTRAL
We view this as a significant opportunity and believe our technology can potentially address a serious unmet need in the market as it relates to visualization and the treatment of Upper GI bleeding  which has an estimated mortality rate of approximately    . There are roughly         Upper GI procedures in the U.S. annually and we continue to receive significant inbound interest from GI physicians who are eager for a solution that allows them to clear adherent blood and clots from their field of view during this critical procedure.,0.08743718260666355,NEUTRAL
Next  let s discuss clinical data generation. I m excited to announce today that we recently began enrollment in a study with the Cleveland Clinic  which will evaluate the clinical and economic benefits of using the Pure-Vu system in patients with emergent lower GI bleeding that are treated in the ICU or the rapid inpatient endoscopy suite. This study is designed to enroll at least    patients to undergo minimal bowel prep in order to provide patients a much faster diagnosis as compared to the current period of    to    hours or more  typically required to complete a full bowl prep.,0.11487128003500402,NEUTRAL
The outcome we receive from this study could begin to challenge the current standard of care for emergent Lower GI bleed patients who are facing urgent need for diagnosis and treatment  but are currently delayed. We expect to have this study fully enrolled before the end of     .,-0.021938495337963104,NEUTRAL
And lastly  I want to talk about strategic partnerships. As it relates to our strategic options  we ve spent time evaluating a number of potential pathways during the back half of      and into     . Our objectives in considering any potential partnership would be aimed at opportunities that could accelerate our commercial efforts and enhance our technology development. Any partnership would also need to unlock clear shareholder value. As we continue to grow awareness and uptake of the Pure-Vu system  we will consider which options best fit our criteria and are actionable.,0.013244277302874252,NEUTRAL

Thank you  Tim  and thank you everyone for joining us today. We reported revenue for the fourth quarter      of approximately         primarily from the sales of Pure-Vu single-use sleeves.,0.47180047968868166,POSITIVE
As Tim discussed  our small commercial organization has been focused on single use sleeve sales with early adopter hospitals that are starting to implement Pure-Vu patient protocol. Growth in the fourth quarter was impacted by the surge in COVID-   cases  and the effect on new technology utilization in the in-patient environment.,0.013782138878013939,NEUTRAL
Over the course of       we expect to grow our number of new system placement and work with hospital value analysis committee to finalize commercial contract at our active sites. We anticipate new and reorders of Pure-Vu sleeves to increase during      and to pursue capital equipment purchases  leases or rentals with targeted accounts.,0.0068321803119033575,NEUTRAL

As reflected in these comparisons of net loss and cash spend activity for      as compared to       the results of our cost cutting measures which we initially put in place at the end of the first quarter have contributed to a significantly extended cash runway.,0.007082663476467133,NEUTRAL
At December          we reported    .  million in cash and cash equivalents. This included the    million from our      term along with Silicon Valley Bank. In January      we further strengthened our cash position through the execution of a warrant exchange agreement with an existing institutional investors  which raised net proceeds of approximately     million.,0.02829163274873281,NEUTRAL
We believe that with this bolstered balance sheet we are poised to execute on our upcoming value creation drivers laid out for       to ensure compliance with our Silicon Valley Bank liquidity covenant with the first quarter of next year and meet our overall anticipated cash needs further into     .,0.07598518580198288,NEUTRAL

Thank you  Andrew and let me summarize the key takeaways from today s call. We are pursuing a global market opportunity for our Pure-Vu Technology and believe we currently have no direct competition. While this leaves us with the challenges of being a first mover  and changing physician behavior  we continue to make steady progress in creating market awareness and adding new hospitals and physicians.,0.25227374641690403,POSITIVE
As COVID-   hospitalizations decline  we believe we will be operating in a more normalized environment  which will improve procedure access for our sales team and enable more opportunities to drive utilization  which will lead to increased demand for the Pure-Vu system.,0.01190192811191082,NEUTRAL
Finally  we are excited about the four value creation drivers I discussed in my earlier remarks  including reimbursement  product innovation  clinical data and strategic partnerships.

Drew Stafford,0.003319564464618452,NEUTRAL
Hi guys  This is Drew on for Matt. Thank you for taking the questions. I just want to start on the sleeve minimum agreement. You know maybe you could share a little bit more detail on how those are structured. You know how many sleeves do you expect those two centers to order and   or I guess how many do they have to order to reach those requirement. And then  you know how should we be thinking about that from  maybe a revenue or quarterly cadence perspective.,0.27656168048270047,POSITIVE
Tim Moran,-0.021768570644780993,NEUTRAL
Yeah Drew  thanks for your question  thanks for joining today. So  first of all we re really excited to be able to ink these first initial committed agreements and as I mentioned  you know in my prepared remarks the capital environment very difficult  right  and at the end of the day our conviction is all around driving this procedure  getting physicians trained and getting them comfortable using the device and really improving patient care. So this is a way to get the product in  when they don t have the capital budget  but also gives us a commitment back pretty much more predictable volumes at least initially.,0.47809693263843656,POSITIVE
While we re not going to give out specific  you know contractual details that we have with these customers  what I can tell you generally is we ve talked before about you know first year utilization  we feel is typically going to be in the seven to ten procedures a month and these agreements are written to fully cover that and we expect them actually to grow much larger than that  because in most of these situations we have just a small number of the physicians who are actually doing the procedure.,-0.024111835286021233,NEUTRAL
So hopefully that gives you a little bit of feel. You can kind of model that out  but that s the way they re structure today. And you know what we d likely expect over time is that their capital budgets free up. I would think that most of these customers would end up then you know moving to either an outright purchase of the capital or you know lease agreement. But right now this is a great way to get them up and running with the product.,0.08943943213671446,MIXED
Drew Stafford,0.003319564464618452,NEUTRAL
Okay  that that s  inaudible  and congrats on a couple of new product evaluations. Can you just remind us of how you know some of those processes are structured  I guess especially during COVID here. I mean what s the requirement from training  what s the requirement from you know as far as having a sales person on the ground or anything like that. And then you know how long does it typically take with some of those account. I mean obviously we ve talked about NYU in the past  before you start seeing meaningful utilization of Pure-Vu.,0.04736408591270447,NEUTRAL
Tim Moran,-0.021768570644780993,NEUTRAL
Yeah  you know it s been an interesting year  right  that s an understatement. So there is probably not a one size fits all answer in terms of the approach that each of these sites have asked us to kind of work within  as it relates to you know the impact of COVID on their staff and you know protocols and things like that. But typically  the structure that we believe optimizes our successes.,-0.10753791779279709,NEUTRAL
You know if we can be there on-site and do initial training for the entire staff that will be associated with the product  as well as of course the physicians  you know and have kind of a kick off meeting if you will and then everyone s on the same page as it relates to what the technology does  what the benefit is. We make sure that we coordinate with the nursing floors right.,0.05280113127082586,NEUTRAL
So if you got these patients that are up on the floor  waiting to have a colonoscopy done  they fully understand they are educated that now there s a solution down in GI that allowed them to do the procedure despite the patient being ready. So there is a lot of coordination that needs to be done.,0.22439387626945972,POSITIVE
So in an ideal situation  we are there on-site  initially doing all of that organizational work if you will. And that has continued in several sites. As a matter of fact our evaluation in Boston that we just did here at the end of the year and into the first quarter  we were able to be on-site despite what was happening with COVID. Their protocols allowed for that  so we can follow that very approach and we had a rep and you know clinical training folks on site.,0.20184496976435184,NEUTRAL
But in some of the other accountant and it s been a little bit of an elongated process throughout this year  we ve not been able to be there. So we had to use remote tools and we talked about this before in the past  but we   you know we really digitized all of our materials  so now we re able to do things very effectively over the phone  via Zoom  you know there s chapter narrated video that our staff has in front of them  so they can see exactly how the system set up and you know it s worked  it s worked out well. It just takes a little bit longer to try to manage it that way.,0.03303203359246254,MIXED
So the sales process  you know I would say has been taking probably upwards of you know six months plus given some of those hurdles  and in the back end the value analysis committees have been on and off meeting  it s been kind of stop and go. So I would say this is a very unusual last    months as it relates to the typical time that it would take to get these deals done.,-0.26068215072155,NEGATIVE
Drew Stafford,0.003319564464618452,NEUTRAL
Yeah  that makes perfect sense. Just last one from me  the Upper GI indication. Maybe if you could just layout the value prop there  How similar or different is that to your current Pure-Vu market and then how should we think about that indication as far as impact your business and maybe      maybe. Thank you.,0.44651621649973094,POSITIVE
Tim Moran,-0.021768570644780993,NEUTRAL
Yeah  we re really excited about this  and as I mentioned earlier  the team  our internal team has done a terrific job from an R D and engineering perspective to continue to hit all of our milestones on the project. So we re on track with getting ready for submission to the FDA  we ll have a product on the market this year.,0.4872210652392823,POSITIVE
The way we re positioning this  not dissimilar to the Lower GI but obviously this is utilized for  bleeding  typically for bleeding in the Upper GI tract  and what we ve heard really time and time again from our customers  very important influential customers they re doing these types of procedures on a daily basis  is that the struggle with blood and adherent blood clots that can form in the stomach and the duodenum and you know visualization becomes a problem.,0.20116684772074223,POSITIVE
So it parallels the Lower GI s. At the end of the day it s all about visualization  so you can see what you need to then treat. So we will have the product on the market. Our initial plan is to do a very targeted   I would call it a kind of a soft launch as soon as we get it out there. We will have those accounts lined up  we ll have the physicians lined up  and will get you know feedback from the market initially  and then we would move into you know a broader launch  but we re very excited about that.,0.17662645177915692,NEUTRAL
We re not going to comment on specific revenue projections at this point  but what I will say is there are approximately         of these procedures a year done in the U.S.  primarily all in hospitals  so it adds   you know call it roughly another     to our kind of total addressable opportunity that we re focused on today in the hospital environment and their synergy  because you re talking about you know same hospitals  same physicians and we think that this is going to be a really nice add-on to the portfolio.,0.2445344775915146,POSITIVE

Yeah  so as Tim mentioned  we re really excited about the study in the Cleveland Clinic and it s really doing something that s you know fairly unheard of with doing colonoscopy with basically you know purgative-based preps  so these significant leaders that you know time is of the essence to get in their to find the source of a bleed and thus creating the spaces if possible. You know we re looking at getting in these patients with no standard purgative. Just a couple of tap water anomalies and they are going in with Pure-Vu to cleanse the colon to find the source of the bleed.,0.03739066421985626,POSITIVE
We anticipate being able to enroll in this study and complete enrollment later this year  and the reality is probably the actual read out of the data you know will be in early     as far as you know any publications  etcetera  happening from it. But again  it s a really unique trial of   we re going forward in these critical patients where there was no crafting  being able to get in there quickly  especially these folks who are in the ICU  if we can you know not only help to get them out of the hospital quicker  but certainly just downgrading them into a regular board can be incredibly significant for the treatment of patients and the cost of hospital.,-0.015867017209529877,MIXED

Yeah  sure David  thanks and thanks for joining. So it s been interesting. You know Q  was definitely a marked point where we saw a procedure volume come back to   you know I think in Q  I talked about   you know call it     to     of pre-pandemic levels  kind of was the feel we had from speaking to our customers and you know that really for the most part continued into Q  and you know I think that s what   you know if we look at Q   it feels about the same. So I wouldn t say that we ve seen a significant improvement  but there hasn t been a terrible decline either.,0.4284867728129029,POSITIVE
I think in the back half of Q   in November-December we talked earlier about how things flattened out a little bit. It was very specific to geographies. You know California where we have several installations  Texas where we have several installations that were just getting hit hard  you know it impacted procedure volumes.,0.01715555042028427,NEUTRAL
I think Q  is probably looking similar to what we saw in Q  and Q   but we are optimistic now as I think everyone is you know with the roll out and really an acceleration of the rollout of the vaccinations that you know we are expecting to see improvement in Q  and you know in talking to physicians in our key hospitals  they ve kind of echoed that  so.,0.09290145337581635,NEUTRAL
You know we re bullish on what we would expect to see procedurally in Q  plus with access  right  because right now we probably have access to you know about   you know real access to about     to     of our account. What I mean by that is we can go in you know without a lot of trouble and be there and be in procedures  but the others have a lot of protocols in place that make it very  very difficult to be there and to get into different units and we still have certain types that we can t get in at all.

Yeah  so we re very pleased with that relationship. You know obviously we have another update today that they are now also you know signed to a committed volume agreement. The physicians that we work with there are terrific and have really embraced Pure-Vu  so I would say generally speaking it s going very well. And yes  it s going to take time to get to that full penetration point  but I think we re seeing   even if you look in this past quarter  we re seeing consistent reordering  we re seeing them gain a significant degree of independence.,0.4904596404521726,POSITIVE
So what I mean by that is they are doing procedures when we re not there  which is the goal  right  and they re getting   you know that just shows the comfort level that they have  and you know we re talking to them about some other ways to collaborate over time here. So I think we ll see them as a very important customer for us moving forward.,0.3012376892147586,POSITIVE
The other thing that s unique if you will about NYU and I think we ve talked about this a little bit is  the way they are structured from a physician s perspective is they have a director of in-patient services  GI Hospital if you will that is on site  on a consistent basis  right. So other facilities will have physicians that are on rotation and if it s a large GI group they might have you know physicians that you know are there doing in-patient rotation once a month or even a longer space between  whereas at NYU you have key physicians that are there each week and their full objective is to work on these in-patients.,-0.033773891627788544,NEUTRAL
So obviously that s a captive audience for us and you know it s a learning that we took over the course of last year  that as we expand our targets  focusing on some of these accounts that are structured that way  can really optimize success and really accelerated success  because you re talking about you know a lot fewer physicians that we need to get up and running  to try to get to you know that standard of care level if you will.,0.311514460016042,POSITIVE
So that s been done something that you know we ve learned from NYU and we are now replicating in other places  and NYU has been helpful in terms of getting us networked to colleagues in other sites across the country that are structured similarly.,0.17838540859520435,NEUTRAL

Mark Pomeranz,0.001987249415833503,NEUTRAL
Yeah  that s correct. You know we are expecting hopefully something in the next few months on the expedite study. Again that was an investigator initiated study by Doctor Jacobson who actually transitioned middle of last year from The Boston Medical Center NGA  so that s kind of slowed down some of the progress on that and moving that forward. So obviously that s driving that data and that publication  so hopeful that that will happen in the next few months as well.,-0.05559789761900902,NEUTRAL

Ben Haynor,0.0008457239891868085,NEUTRAL
Excellent  So just curious on any more color you can provide on the ICD-   code presentation. Do you have any sense of how that went  You know just kind of looking at the options that are available to the agency. It looks like other than the one that s you know kind of the NTAP supportive one  it almost seems like a decoy option and it only adds intra procedure to the existing coding. I mean what are kind of the thoughts around that ,0.27403461933135986,POSITIVE
Tim Moran,-0.021768570644780993,NEUTRAL
Yeah  so why don t I start and if we want to get into more granular detail  Ben I can pass it to Mark. But  so we did participate in that meeting. I think we did it nice job and represented what we re looking to try to do with Pure-Vu. We did get the recommendation from CMS  so they put forth   there s various options that they can choose from.,0.2854361329227686,POSITIVE
They put forth a recommendation before it goes out and they are suggesting and recommending that Pure-Vu receive an ICD-   code. So that s positive right  and now what s happening is  as we mentioned  it will go to an open comment period  where folks can weigh in on any feedback they have on that  and then it will come back in-house and they ll ultimately make the final decision later this year.,0.052398765459656715,NEUTRAL
But you know that s an important part of the process if you will as we as move towards the NTAP  right  which would actually provide the coverage. So the ICD-   as you know is a way to track the procedure. So it s important that you kind of get through that initial hurdle and I think we feel like we represented ourselves well in that process. Did that answer your questions Ben ,0.061299681779928505,NEUTRAL
Ben Haynor,0.0008457239891868085,NEUTRAL
Yeah  I mean that s what I was looking for and then you know kind of on the open comment period  you wouldn t seem to   you wouldn t expect that you know anyone would be highly motivated to come out against you guys  given there is no competition.,-0.04073084518313408,NEUTRAL
Tim Moran,-0.021768570644780993,NEUTRAL
Yeah  we would not expect that  but obviously they do have to go through their process right and you know we ll see where that ends up  but no  we wouldn t expect that.,-0.06921411864459515,MIXED

You know  the way we are looking at this  you know from a reimbursement perspective  you know I m pleased with the progress that we re making and the team s making. You know the NTAP submission is you know one of the various programs to obtain reimbursement  this being for a new technology and you know that one being specific to in-patient and you know we view that   we don t have currently headwinds for in-patient from a reimbursement perspective. However  you know we do see that as an accelerator  potential accelerator you know if we were to be awarded that additional coverage  you know that could help  particularly with the value analysis committee  the financial end of that process.,0.04977111448533833,NEUTRAL
Ben Haynor,0.0008457239891868085,NEUTRAL

Ben Haynor,0.0008457239891868085,NEUTRAL
Got it  And then on the Cleveland Clinic study  with the double anemia protocol     patients  so I mean that s a kind of a pilot study. How come you think it ll take so long to enroll ,0.0739678181707859,NEUTRAL
Tim Moran,-0.021768570644780993,NEUTRAL
So Ben  what I ll say is  we are just not going to put up a hard date on it  only because it s an Investigator Initiative Study  so we don t fully control that. But you know I think you know given the size of the institution and the number of patients that we you know outlined here  it certainly has the potential to move relatively quickly. But at this point until we have better line of sight  which I think we will. By next quarter we ll know how many we ve done and what the pace looks like  we can provide a  probably a more specific targeted date  but for now we wanted to keep it general.,0.011255025863647461,NEUTRAL
Ben Haynor,0.0008457239891868085,NEUTRAL
Okay  that s fare. And then finally on the minimum sleeve purchase commitments  you know I know some of these are obviously larger institutions  more than one location. You know as you start out  you have kind of seven to    procedures a month  and that you are doing at maybe at the main location. What happens when they say this is great  let s expand these protocols system wide  We want more of these  How do you handle that  I mean is it kind of that seven to    procedures per hospital or you d do it on a bigger basis  or how would you think about structuring that down the road should things go well ,-0.04364804923534393,NEUTRAL
Tim Moran,-0.021768570644780993,NEUTRAL
Yeah  so it s a great question. So one  that was one the reasons why we ve decided to make these    month agreements  right. So they re not three years or something  because things will change and I think as the new technology in the market  you know as we re out there  you know as they said earlier  really our biggest objective right  and challenge is change in behavior  right. So we re asking physicians and staff to do something differently than they ve done in the past  right  any type of new technology.,0.16418887674808502,NEUTRAL
So getting the product in the door and having them have access to it  you know we re comfortable with the minimums that we put into this first    months based on  you know as I said a small number of positions utilizing it  because we believe that as you have it on site  you know it s our job to be on site training additional physicians and they will immediately as they start to do cases for the first time  they will see the value right.,0.42297049425542355,POSITIVE
So I think the minimums that are put into these agreements from our perspective  you know will get outdated pretty quickly. You know if we can get this in the hands of additional physicians and at the end of the    month period  you know we ll look at what that next agreement might look like.,-0.08835033979266882,NEUTRAL
I could see in the future potentially having options where it s you know it s either just an outright purchase or lease or you know rental or we might have different minimum requirements    months from now. But we wrote them as    month agreement  so we have flexibility.,-0.004926897585391998,MIXED

Destiny Buch,0.002884834073483944,NEUTRAL
Hi  This is Destiny on for Jeff. Thank you for taking my questions. I hope you are all well. I guess I d like to start with revenue. I saw in some of your commentary that you mentioned a portion was from new accounts and a portion was from existing accounts. I m wondering if you could help us understand what this proportion look like  even just at a high level  does have to be specific  but perhaps a range ,0.23524735355749726,NEUTRAL
Tim Moran,-0.021768570644780993,NEUTRAL
Yeah  sure Destiny. Thanks for joining. Yes  so we definitely don t want to you know start to break it out to that level of detail  but I would say that a large portion of the early revenues that we re seeing here are coming from existing repeat orders. So what that will look like is in any given quarter  the majority of the revenue is coming from repeat orders and then you re going to potentially get a couple initial orders to get going and I think that happened here in the last quarter. So we had an account that you know switched and got the approval right at the end of the quarter and placed their first paid purchase  but that s obviously a small majority of the revenue that we re seeing right now.,-0.16558202728629112,NEGATIVE
Destiny Buch,0.002884834073483944,NEUTRAL

Tim Moran,-0.021768570644780993,NEUTRAL
Well  you know I do think that that will start to pick up  because we have several of these types of agreements that are pending  you know that we ve been actively working really into the end of Q  as it got delayed with some of the COVID-   issue and here in Q . So just depending on when they make the commitment and place their first order  that amount could certainly change.,-0.03141971677541733,NEUTRAL
And you know I think  as procedure volume comes back  just kind of going back to what I was saying earlier  you know we expect many of these existing sites that have been evaluating and have had elongated valuations to get fully converted and start purchasing. So yeah  I think that that certainly will start to ramp-up in terms of new purchases coming in as opposed to the repeat orders that we re getting from our earliest sites right now.,-0.0883401520550251,NEUTRAL
Destiny Buch,0.002884834073483944,NEUTRAL
Okay  got it. And could you just remind us of your efforts OUS  is there anything going on even you know R D that we should be aware of ,0.1417517326772213,NEUTRAL
Tim Moran,-0.021768570644780993,NEUTRAL
So  yeah so if we think about OUS  we ve had to have several activities. We talk about some of the regulatory  you know the updated CE mark which is obviously important. We have done  I would say a high level exploration and diligence into Europe and into Asia as it relates to the opportunity for Pure-Vu and we ve had inbound request from several different entities  interested in either selling or you know having access to Pure-Vu in their market  so we re evaluating those.,0.04221633495762944,NEUTRAL
I think right now our focus is very much as you know on the U.S. So to access Europe or to access China or Japan you know obviously we would be most interested in doing that with a partner  and as I said earlier  you know we had significant dialogue with a variety of different entities  both large kind of manufacturers  medical device companies  as well as key distributors in certain regions around the world. So we continue to evaluate  have discussions  kind of do our diligence.,0.07045651064254344,NEUTRAL
So we re laying the foundation for an eventual entrance into those markets  but right now you know given COVID and you know balancing our cash burn  the focus is obviously heavily on the U.S.,-0.2193135805428028,NEUTRAL

Boobalan Pachaiyappan,-0.04033866338431835,NEUTRAL
Hi  This is Boobalan dialing in for Yi Chen. Just a follow-up ICD-   reimbursements  how do you think this quote up on approval will affect your company s top and bottom line  Can you quantify  or if it can t be quantified now  when would that be possible ,-0.05756444204598665,NEUTRAL
Tim Moran,-0.021768570644780993,NEUTRAL
Thanks Boobalan for joining in and thanks for your question. So I would just say generally you know the way   right now we don t have you know line of sight into what the potential reimbursement amount may be  right  so we can t comment on that.,0.3601297093555331,POSITIVE
But I think generally what we re seeing it as   strategically if you think about the NTAP  it would be an accelerator right to adoption. Because if you had some additional reimbursement on the Pure-Vu sleeve in the hospital environment  I think it would allow us to work through the value analysis committee  financial analysis much easier  you know because it s reducing obviously the overall cost burden.,0.030590329319238663,NEUTRAL
But keep in mind that today on an individual patient basis  individual procedure  we re showing a return on the investment you know with one sleeve. So this would just  you know as I said serve as more of an accelerator if you will. So I don t see it having any anything but positive upside to you know revenue uptake and obviously we wouldn t change our pricing based on that either.,-0.02423931658267975,NEUTRAL
Boobalan Pachaiyappan,-0.04033866338431835,NEUTRAL
That s helpful. And where do you stand on the REDUCE study and do you plan to initiate any new clinical studies for this year ,0.12768539413809776,NEUTRAL
Tim Moran,-0.021768570644780993,NEUTRAL
So  I can ask Mark to talk about   you know we actually do have another study that we re going to initiate in Europe. So Mark  do you want to just provide  just a quick overview there ,0.028873587027192116,NEUTRAL
Mark Pomeranz,0.001987249415833503,NEUTRAL
Sure  actually just to comment. I mean you mentioned the REDUCE study  which was going to be an open label registry  which we did back when we did our cost cutting last year. We did put that study in the back burner  and so right now we re focused on the Cleveland Clinic study that we talked about earlier  and those patients in the ICU.,-0.035261642187833786,NEUTRAL
And then we are initiating a small study also in Europe and we re going to see some of the key thought leaders there and that study is really focused on patients that have   it s called a difficulty in prepping in the outpatient scenario and are typically coming back almost on a yearly basis  because they never got a good example. The physician that are examining them constantly just to make sure that whatever calls they missed on the prior procedure hopefully as they get larger  they will catch them before they become cancerous problems. So we will be initiating that study coming up in the next quarter or so as well.,-0.04844465386122465,NEUTRAL
So again  it ll be an interesting population  because that will also feed into some of the issues in the out-patient in the U.S. for these patient that are on a reduced surveillance interval  because they don t get a good preparation and there s concern of an inevitable cancer. So it s a nice way for us to get some early data on that  as well as see some of the key thought leaders in Europe as well.,0.3755260379984975,POSITIVE
Boobalan Pachaiyappan,-0.04033866338431835,NEUTRAL

Tim Moran,-0.021768570644780993,NEUTRAL
Yeah sure  you know listen  we have the system safe in more than    sites. I would say Boobalan right now  if we kind of think about COVID and access  there is about   I ll call it about two-thirds of those that are active. We expect the others to kind of pick back up.,0.004675049334764481,NEUTRAL
We are working with as I said earlier  a very lean commercial team. So we are remaining very focused on targets that have the highest potential to close. The most quickly and also kind of play a strategic role in the overall foundation setting that we are doing and I would say that s the mode that we are in here as you know. And I think had we not lost a handful of quarters with COVID  we would have probably been you know through that and further along.,0.24166786950081587,NEUTRAL
But we ll continue to strategically add new sites I would say each and every quarter as we just did  as we reported in Q  and we re continuing here in Q   but we re going to do it smart. And as we as we look at       we will also think about where we ll expand the commercial organization in targeted geographies that we believe the ROI will be there  and that will allow it to accelerate  bringing on additional sites as well. So that s just the way we re thinking about it right now.,0.15564650623127818,NEUTRAL

Thank you  Andy and hello to everyone on today s call. First and foremost  like all companies around the world  we re pleased by the recent positive news of the vaccine rollout. We remain optimistic though we re prepared to operate through continued volatility until the virus is fully contained. Our teams have proven their agility to operate through uncertainty while also staying focused on the long term  and we once again demonstrated that agility in Q . It s why I wouldn t trade our position with anyone. The power of NIKE is our consistency and the strength of our global portfolio. Throughout the pandemic  we have stayed focused on our unique advantages  and we ve been resolute in fueling innovation  and our brand is as strong as ever.,0.41638892388436943,POSITIVE
I am proud of our results this quarter. Q  saw us continue to deliver consumers new products  new campaigns  the energy from our roster of athletes and more. Our strategy puts the member at the center and keeps us in the lead and we will continue to drive even further competitive separation. And still  we push our own expectations of ourselves. Last week  we released our      Impact Report and announced our new      Purpose Targets. Our new  -year purpose targets offer a road map to       outlining clear goals  action plans and accountability. And for the first time  that accountability now includes linking executive compensation to our Purpose Goals.,0.31045106510282494,POSITIVE
Our      targets will keep us focused on accelerating our efforts against a wide range of priorities  from sustainability to representation  to investing in the future of sport in communities around the world. I encourage everyone to take a look at the report at purpose.nike.com. Ultimately  this isn t just the right thing to do  it makes great business sense. Setting purpose targets for ourselves creates long-term value  raises the bar for our industry and redefines our own potential for a positive impact in the world. Our commitment to constant improvement is why I continue to be so amazed by this team. I have never been more confident in our leadership and teams around the world as we stay on the offense  accelerating our long-term strategy. And as I said  this continues to be a dynamic external environment  but I am proud how adaptable NIKE is. No matter what happens  COVID spikes  forced enclosed   store closures  port congestion on the West Coast and more  this team responds with solutions. We adjust and we win.,0.37928653025301173,POSITIVE
Our brand continues to deeply connect all over the world. We remain consumers  number one favorite brand in all    of our key cities in both men s and women s businesses. We re also seeing particularly strong connections in Greater China  where our strong portfolio of brands  including Jordan and Converse  is helping to extend our leadership position. All over the world  the relationships we have with consumers cannot easily be replicated. Our brand differentiates us  driven by the unique competitive advantages that we enjoy.,0.36297416550223716,POSITIVE
First  NIKE s connections with consumers are driven by sport and cultural authenticity. Our roster of athletes is the greatest in the world. Naomi Osaka continues to emerge as a truly global sport icon  having won   Grand Slam titles at only    years old. Kylian Mbapp  became the youngest footballer ever to score    Champions League goals  leading Paris Saint-Germain into the quarterfinals. The NBA All-Star Game has proved yet again of our dominance in basketball  with Lebron s team taking on KD s  Giannis winning MVP and a young core of Jordan Brand superstars led by Zion and Luka. And the energy of March Madness tips off today  with Jordan and NIKE schools making up    of the top    women s teams and    of the top    men s teams. No brand connects with consumers with the power and culture of sport like NIKE and we pride ourselves on our leadership role to drive hope and inspiration all over the world.,0.2771215622778982,POSITIVE
Second  our brand is powered by our global scale. This is particularly critical advantage as we continue to fuel our digital transformation. We ve had tremendous success in digital  quickly pivoting to serve consumers as they shift to digital channels. But even as this consumer shift is felt across industries  NIKE s digital transformation remains a unique advantage. Scale matters. The strength of our brand allows us to stay personal at scale with consumers in all of our geographies. And more than ever  the portfolio effect of being a truly global brand is powerful.,0.31284655575291254,POSITIVE
Third  we stay at the front of the pack  thanks to our compelling consumer experiences. Last quarter  we announced the launch of SNKRS Live  our first product drop via live streaming. In Q   we doubled the number of countries with live streaming  adding Japan  Germany and Italy. We re seeing phenomenal engagement for this live interaction with average viewing duration doubling to over    minutes I wish it were    years  well above the industry norms. We re also creating content to connect members to the sport and sneaker community  content that drives the highest engagement on sneakers. So whether it s through the SNKRS App  our Activity apps  platforms like TikTok and more  we continue to find compelling ways to deliver an authentic NIKE experience in digital.,0.22408388333860785,NEUTRAL
And fourth  the Jordan Brand had a very strong quarter  growing double digits in Q . This growth was broad-based  led by our biggest growth opportunities  digital  international  apparel and women s. In fact  Jordan s women s business was up nearly triple digits  a strong statement of how the brand continues to serve a broader set of consumers. Q  also saw the launch of the Air Jordan    Jubilee  one of the largest and most successful footwear launches ever  with more than      million in revenue. We are incredibly confident about the continued growth opportunity for the Jordan Brand moving forward.,0.36016681938781403,POSITIVE
As always  our brand is propelled by our unmatched innovation investment and pipeline. Innovation s at our core  reflecting not just our foundational values  but the values we share with consumers. We don t just innovate for the elite athlete we use innovation and design to solve problems for all consumers no matter their sport or style of play. And we consistently bring fresh new product to market  supported by compelling storytelling that helps drive consumer demand. At the core of our innovation engine is our edge in performance. And we continue to use this edge to evolve some of the most popular products for everyday runners.,0.19530544977169484,NEUTRAL
This quarter  we focused on a key problem for runners  with new footwear that continues our mission to unlock injury prevention. The ZoomX Invincible Run offers a brand-new look for Nike Running  with increased foam in the midsole. This creates a soft ride that makes running feel easy with incredible energy return and is designed to help reduce running-related injuries. We also just launched the React Escape  a shoe specifically designed for the female runner. The React Escape s silhouette  materials and design details are all aimed at new runners  and it s seeing great sell-through as it encourages more women to pick up the sport.,0.3675453150062822,POSITIVE
We are also driving our sustainability agenda through strong product innovation. We ve set ambitious goals around the use of sustainable materials throughout our line and we ll continue to invest in new materials and methods of make to maintain our leadership position here. Last month  we launched Cosmic Unity  our first performance shoe under Our Move to Zero initiative. This initiative  which moves us towards zero waste and zero carbon  embraces circular design as a guiding principle. Cosmic Unity  which has also been already been worn on court by some of the NBA s best  including Anthony Davis  is NIKE s first performance shoe made out of at least     recycled content by weight and offers just a hint of our future with sustainable product. We are also resolute in our pursuit of making sport a daily habit for all athletes. A great example of this work is the Nike Go FlyEase. Its easy-on  easy-off design solves for an ambitious North Star  the creation of a truly hands-free shoe. This is a shoe for everyone  from elite athletes to parents with their hands full. We re initially launching Nike Go FlyEase first for our most engaged members with broader consumer availability coming later this year. And we continue to push our industry in creating product through better consumer insights.,0.1983628814923577,NEUTRAL
This quarter  we acquired Datalogue  a data integration platform that will help us process  analyze and act on the data we enjoy  thanks to our scale advantage. This lets us harness the full power of our data  turning it into more actionable insights and enabling greater speed. As part of our recent organizational realignment  we also put our data teams alongside the creative teams to unlock this opportunity. NIKE has always married the art and science of product creation and the move towards deeper and more dynamic insights  along with our talent and investments in data science and machine learning  creates a capacity that no other brand has.,0.06144783059426118,NEUTRAL
Let s quickly talk about the Tokyo Olympics and Para Olympics. Despite the unique circumstances surrounding the games  we look forward to leveraging that world stage to showcase our innovation and purpose commitments. Our pipeline and cadence has continued its pace  including some new innovations and the scaling of a few of our recent innovation platforms. This summer in Tokyo  we look forward to sharing the next-generation of FlyEase and its mission of inclusive innovation  as well as delivering some new and exciting women-specific innovations.,0.24549363804544555,NEUTRAL
The last thing I d like to discuss is digital. We re taking even greater advantage of our vast digital opportunity as we create the future of retail. We know that our consumers want a consistent  seamless and premium experience. And so alongside our strategic partners  we continue to consolidate the marketplace to give our consumers that premium experience. Our owned digital business is thriving  with growth of     on a currency-neutral basis during the quarter. This growth was led by North America  which had its first-ever quarter with    billion in digital revenue.,0.07891469693277031,NEUTRAL
As you know  we set a bold vision for digital across owned and operated and partnered  being     of our business in the long term. We have made significant progress to date  increasing the digital mix of our business by more than    points in Q  versus the prior year. NIKE s ability to sustainably grow digital for the long-term is rooted in our member connections and compelling experiences that only NIKE can offer. And our members are more engaged than ever  with an over     increase in monthly engaged users for the quarter  led by our SNKRS App  where we re seeing  x the engagement in monthly active users versus last year. This heightened engagement is translating into buying. We re seeing continued member growth outpace total digital growth as buying members increased     versus the prior year. And these connections extend beyond digital. In our own stores  member demand penetration rates are seeing meaningful increases  enabled by robust store training programs  member-specific promotions and enhanced account linking capabilities. This is critical as we strategically focus on better serving and driving repeat engagement with active  high-value members across all of our channels.,0.0978044689836679,NEUTRAL
In the end  NIKE is staying on offense and we are focused on extending our leadership position. We have a proven playbook  led by digital  and everything we ve seen makes us more confident in our future. Our focus is on the long-term and we are not slowing down.,0.30946814952767454,POSITIVE
And with that  I will turn the call over to Matt.,0.047174857929348946,NEUTRAL
Matt Friend,0.013595406315289438,NEUTRAL
Thank you  John and hello to everyone on the call. As we have entered into a new calendar year filled with new opportunities amidst pandemic-related challenges  our focus has not wavered. We continue to position NIKE to win today and over the long term. We are now   year into managing through these dynamics and we have met every hurdle with leadership and decisive action. While we are optimistic about the pace of vaccine distribution and how this will enable safe reopening of the global economy in the near future  the effects of the virus continue to create short-term volatility in our business performance. For example  in Q   disruption in the global supply chain due to container shortages  transportation delays and port congestion has interrupted the flow of inventory supply. The result has been supply shortages relative to continued strong marketplace demand.,0.43355066946242005,POSITIVE
In North America specifically  inventory supply was delayed by more than   weeks  impacting the timing of wholesale shipments and growth in the quarter. In EMEA  additional COVID-related lockdowns caused a higher number of physical retail stores to be closed and or operate on reduced hours versus the prior quarter. But our operating priorities remain unchanged and we re focused on what we can control  optimize marketplace supply and demand with speed and agility  accelerate the pace of direct connections with consumers and exert our financial strength to move faster towards our long-term strategic vision of the consumer direct acceleration. I am proud of how our teams continue to respond  demonstrating how to win in a dynamic and rapidly changing environment. And our results reflect our team s unwavering commitment to serving our consumers. John couldn t have said it any better  we adjust and we win. This is the mentality that will propel us forward as we focus on the future.,-0.007258441299200058,NEUTRAL
Now as I reflect on the third quarter  I want to highlight two important points. First  NIKE s brand momentum is as strong as ever  and we are driving focused growth in our largest opportunities. Our innovation and product franchises are resonating with consumers. This translated into double-digit retail sales growth over the holiday season. We drove a higher proportion of full-price sales with lower markdown activity  and this retail momentum has continued into the spring season.,0.09177001577336341,NEUTRAL
At our core  NIKE is a growth company. And we delivered another strong quarter of performance against our largest long-term growth opportunities. Greater China set the pace for our geographies  growing revenue     on a currency-neutral basis. We set another record for Chinese New Year  with digital demand doubling versus fiscal    . NIKE Digital grew      led by strong growth across our mobile app ecosystem. Demand on the NIKE App grew     versus the prior year. Women s drove over-indexing revenue growth for the quarter  including nearly     growth in NIKE Digital. And with high double-digit retail sales growth across the marketplace  we are increasing NIKE s market share across our key markets. And last  the Jordan Brand grew      delivering its third consecutive quarter of double-digit growth with incredible brand momentum and a clear formula of growth for the future. We are exceeding pre-pandemic levels of business  and our brand momentum is clear. From our relentless flow of new product and storytelling  to our deep consumer connections  our extensive portfolio of athletes and teams and the scale of our digital platforms  NIKE is positioned to drive high-quality  sustainable and profitable growth across our portfolio.,0.10334421292645857,NEUTRAL
Second  this quarter demonstrated how a more direct  digitally enabled NIKE will fuel long-term strategic and financial value. Our consumer direct acceleration strategy is driving a meaningful and broader marketplace shift and it is transforming our financial model. Our own digital business has grown more than     year-to-date  and our mix of owned and partner digital now exceeds     of our total business. This quarter  we increased member buying frequency and grew retained buying members versus the prior year and the prior quarter. Looking ahead to fiscal     and beyond  we expect digital to continue to be our fastest-growing marketplace channel  with digital mix increasing towards our     vision.,0.11637697811238468,NEUTRAL
NIKE physical stores are another key enabler to drive our consumer direct acceleration. And our monobrand store expansion strategy creates an incremental market opportunity for NIKE. New retail concepts such as Live  Rise and Unite will create distinctive  authentic and premium NIKE consumer experiences in the marketplace. They will accelerate NIKE member acquisition at scale  while unlocking higher retail productivity. They will recapture displaced consumer demand as we restructure the wholesale marketplace with our strategic partners. And most importantly  they will accelerate NIKE Digital growth by scaling online to offline capabilities as our physical presence reaches a greater number of consumers. A great example of this are the   new Nike Live concepts we opened in Greater China this quarter  where member checkout rates reached      paving the way for connected member journeys and member-led digital growth. We look forward to scaling these new retail concepts into fiscal    .,0.059873132791835815,NEUTRAL
As I ve said before  this strategic shift to increasingly direct and personalized connections with consumers unlock strategic and financial opportunity for NIKE. This quarter  NIKE Direct gross margins contributed to our overall gross margin expansion of     basis points  being fueled by a higher mix of digital  which carries a higher gross margin rate as well as optimization of new pricing capabilities using advanced analytics in North America. We are also continuing to test and learn within our full funnel digital marketing activities and our pace of learning is accelerating with so much opportunity ahead.,0.03980894750566222,NEUTRAL
During Q  in North America  we leveraged data to identify consumer cohorts and feature personalized product recommendations to members to both activate members who have never purchased and increase repeat purchasing. We expect Datalogue to amplify our speed in analyzing consumer data and inform product  marketing and service recommendations  ultimately increasing member buying frequency  basket size and member retention rates. It is clear that our shift to a more direct  member-centric business is beginning to drive strategic and financial value for NIKE and we are confident we are making the right investments in the areas that matter most.,0.03957315010484308,NEUTRAL
Now let s turn to the details of our third quarter financial results and operating segment performance. NIKE  Inc. revenue grew    in Q   declining    on a currency-neutral basis  as NIKE Direct grew      led by strong NIKE Digital growth  offset by declines in our wholesale business due to the timing of wholesale shipments caused by global supply chain challenges in North America and mandatory store closures in EMEA. Gross margin increased     basis points versus the prior year  resulting from higher full price product margins  due in part to geography mix and favorable NIKE Digital mix  partially offset by lower NIKE Direct rate as we continue to manage inventory levels due to COVID-   as well as foreign exchange headwinds.,-0.02496444620192051,NEUTRAL
SG A declined    in the quarter  as we shifted certain demand creation initiatives to better align our investments with product delivery time lines and market conditions  along with lower operating overhead due primarily to lower wage related costs versus the prior year and continued expense management. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was   .   compared to  .   for the same period last year due to decreased benefits from discrete items and a shift in earnings mix  in part due to the impact of the COVID-   pandemic. Third quarter diluted earnings per share was   .    up     versus the prior year. As a reminder  prior year EPS included a   .   non-cash FX-related charge associated with the planned transition to a strategic distributor model in South America.,-0.2719427766278386,NEGATIVE
With that  let s turn to our operating segments. In North America  Q  revenue declined     on a currency-neutral basis and EBIT increased    on a reported basis. We saw strong retail sales growth over the holiday season and drove clean marketplace inventory due to our first half supply and demand management actions. However  starting in late December  container shortages and West Coast port congestion began to increase the transit times of inventory supply by more than   weeks. The result was a lack of available supply  delayed shipments to wholesale partners and lower-than-expected quarterly revenue growth. We expect to capture this delayed revenue in the fourth quarter. NIKE Direct  however  grew     on a currency-neutral basis  led by NIKE Digital growth of more than     and we have seen this momentum continue into March.,-0.29911838518455625,NEGATIVE
This quarter  we accelerated analytics capabilities to dynamically adjust pricing and fulfillment alternatives as we balance consumer demand  inventory availability and profitability. We also prioritized available product supply to NIKE Direct and our strategic partners. Inventory in North America grew     versus the prior year. We had extraordinarily high levels of in-transit inventory due to increased transit times. Inventory units in our distribution centers declined nearly    . With strong consumer demand continuing through the spring season and marketplace inventory down high double digits versus the prior year  we expect continued full price momentum  despite the short-term supply disruption and elevated levels of in-transit inventory related to ongoing global supply chain dynamics.,0.004396822303533554,NEUTRAL
In EMEA  Q  revenue declined    on a currency-neutral basis and EBIT declined    on a reported basis. Across most countries in Western Europe  government restrictions caused an acceleration of store closures  with approximately     of our NIKE-owned stores closed over the last   months of the quarter. We have leveraged our supply and demand playbook and specifically Express Lane to recalibrate marketplace inventory. Excess inventory in EMEA is manageable and lower than during the first wave of lockdowns. Assuming lockdown restrictions begin to ease by mid-April  we expect EMEA inventory to be normalized in the first quarter of fiscal    .,-0.018647387623786926,NEUTRAL
As of today  approximately     of our NIKE-owned stores are closed and this situation continues to be dynamic. But in markets where our stores have reopened  we are seeing strong consumer response and continued brand momentum  with higher conversion rates and strong comp sales growth year-over-year  complementing strong digital growth. With NIKE-owned and partner stores mostly closed  we leveraged the strength of our NIKE Digital business  which grew     on a currency-neutral basis  led by the NIKE App  which grew triple digits in the quarter  and NIKE Digital demand has continued to grow triple digits in March.,0.06275514233857393,NEUTRAL
With that  let s turn to Greater China  which achieved its second consecutive    billion quarter and grew     on a currency-neutral basis  with EBIT growth of     on a reported basis. NIKE Direct grew     versus the prior year  with more than     growth in digital and nearly     growth in NIKE-owned stores as the retail market largely returned to normal  including strong double-digit growth in partner retail stores  widening our market lead as the favorite brand with consumers. As I mentioned earlier  Chinese New Year was a key highlight and through our Express Lane offense  we created and delivered hyperlocal products to celebrate the moment  including the Dunk Low and the women s Dunk Disrupt  which both instantly sold out. Our women s business grew more than     versus the prior year and our   new Nike Live stores are resonating deeply with her since opening. In digital  we focused on engaging and serving members across multiple platforms  including live stream and social media. During Chinese New Year  we doubled our number of high-value members. We also   while also increasing member retention. We re excited by the opportunity we see ahead and so we are accelerating investment in Greater China  including in the local consumer digital experience  new retail concepts and omni-channel integration with our owned and partner stores.,0.12353288638405502,NEUTRAL
Finally  in our APLA geography  Q  revenue declined    on a currency-neutral basis and was temporarily impacted by the transition of our business in Brazil to a strategic distributor model  partially offset by continued strength in South Korea and Pacific. And Q  EBIT grew    versus the prior year on a reported basis. NIKE Digital grew nearly     on a currency-neutral basis and we focused on member engagement and the scaling of consumer services like member days. In Japan  we drove record weeks of member buying  launched our interactive live streaming on SNKRS and activated new O O capabilities. In Mexico  we more than doubled our digital growth and we plan to launch the NIKE mobile app in the first half of fiscal    .,0.02595227025449276,NEUTRAL
I will now turn to our financial outlook. This past year has been one of the most dynamic operating environments in our history  and Q  was no exception. Despite these continued challenges  we remain focused on serving the consumer while making clear operating decisions with speed and agility. We can see the near-term operating environment with increasing clarity yet we remain focused on what s required to win for the long term. With that in mind  we are now more confident in our full year outlook for revenue and expect low to mid-teens growth versus the prior year.,0.17556297115515918,NEUTRAL
Specifically for Q   in our least comparable quarter of the fiscal year  we expect revenue growth of roughly     versus the prior year. This reflects government-mandated restrictions in Europe starting to ease in April and inventory transit times slowly improving in North America. We now expect gross margin to expand up to    basis points versus the prior year  reflecting the continued shifts we ve seen to our more profitable NIKE Direct business  partially offset by higher logistics and freight costs and higher markdowns to liquidate excess inventory in EMEA. Foreign exchange is now estimated to be a roughly    basis point headwind on the full year.,-0.011594249866902828,NEUTRAL
We expect SG A dollars will be slightly up versus the prior year as we rebuild investment levels and demand creation towards pre-pandemic levels and continue to invest to accelerate the pace of our digital transformation. We expect our effective tax rate to be in the low to mid-teens for the full year. And finally  we will resume moderate levels of share repurchase beginning in the fourth quarter. We are confident in our outlook for strong free cash flow growth  which enables us to accelerate capital returns while making the necessary investments to enable our consumer direct acceleration.,0.06656502385158092,NEUTRAL
Looking ahead to fiscal      as I said earlier  we are already exceeding our pre-pandemic levels of business. And I expect the momentum we are seeing to translate into continued strong revenue growth. I will provide more specific guidance for fiscal     on our next earnings call. As a growth company  our offense is working. NIKE s brand momentum is as strong as ever. Our product is resonating  the pipeline is strong and our brands are more deeply connected to consumers than ever before. The pace of our digital transformation is also accelerating and we are investing against the large market opportunity we see. We are converting more consumers into members and connecting more deeply  more frequently and more meaningfully via our digital platforms and ultimately also through our One Nike Marketplace strategic partners. My optimism for NIKE s long-term potential has never been higher.,0.25667871357291006,POSITIVE

I guess  I was wondering on the inventory  I think the delayed flow of inventory you talked about your confidence in essentially just moving everything into the fourth quarter. Just   can you just give us a little bit more color in terms of   will that be largely into the wholesale where you sort of missed some of the sales  Are you going to move it to more the apps or the online  the SNKRS App or Nike.com app  Just could you give us a little more color around the plans to move that inventory in the fourth quarter  Thanks.,-0.06837588548660278,NEUTRAL
John Donahoe,0.0005607295388472266,NEUTRAL
Sure. Well  as I mentioned  we saw an extension of transit times of inventory by up to   weeks. And what that means is that across the marketplace  we were anticipating to have more available supply in the third quarter than ultimately what we were able to have to satisfy demand across both the direct side of the business and across our wholesale partners. We ve now effectively absorbed the longer lead times through our third quarter. And so we do expect a more consistent flow of inventory in the fourth quarter  recognizing that transit times are elevated versus the prior year  but we expect a more consistent flow of inventory from here. I mentioned  Bob  in my prepared remarks that we continue to see strong demand across the marketplace. And we re seeing stronger demand. We continue to see stronger demand in differentiated retail  which is our strategic partners  than we re seeing an undifferentiated retail. And so we will continue to prioritize inventory for our strategic partners and for NIKE Direct. And when we look at where marketplace inventory is today  it s down high double digits versus where it was a year ago. And so there is strong demand for that inventory across our strategic partners and NIKE Direct  and we continue to   we intend to continue to fulfill that demand in both of those locations.,0.028531447052955627,NEUTRAL

Hey  guys. Thanks for taking our questions and Matt  I wanted to ask you  I think you just said that you raised the revenue growth rate for the year. Obviously  that helps add a lot of confidence to your ability to unlock some of that inventory. But I think you previously described that the SG A for the year at up low singles  and now you re saying up slightly  while you re raising revenue growth. But you did say there was some reinvestment in demand creation there  too. So I m trying to put the   just at a high level  the picture together. It seems like there is either much more efficient demand creation going on that we can think about as the model kind of builds back post COVID longer term  or better leverage on the operating overhead expense line. Maybe you could just help us think about why the SG A is able to stay at a fairly manageable level there while you keep raising the revenue line ,0.11438152194023132,POSITIVE

Sure. Well  I should start by saying that as we get into the fourth quarter  the comparisons start to get pretty challenging as you look year-over-year. The comparisons aren t going to be linear as compared to where we ve been in prior quarters  nor will they be intuitive. But when I talk about investment levels  I need to start with the core principle  which is NIKE is a growth company. And so as we continue to see the market opportunity in front of us  we are poised and in this position of strength to be able to accelerate investment against the things that are most critical in order to enable and drive our consumer direct acceleration strategy. Now in the middle of COVID  we got extremely focused on what matters most. And we reallocated resources and tightly   and from a disciplined perspective  managed our expenses so that we could continue investing against the things that matter most to our strategy  like our tech   end-to-end tech transformation  digitizing our supply chain and ultimately investing in the marketplace. And so we ve continued to do that while we ve been able to manage other expenses more tightly as a result of the environment we re in.,0.11458205431699753,NEUTRAL
As we start to look at coming out of the pandemic  we don t intend to just add it back in  okay  Every dollar we re putting back in we know is going to create or we have a plan to create a return on it. And so we re taking advantage of the moment to be able to do that and we will continue to accelerate investment against those levels. But to your point  historically  prior to COVID  we were at about     of revenue in terms of our SG A levels  and we ve been able to manage through the last   the first three quarters of this year  closer to    . And demand creation has been a source of leverage over this period  the reduction in sport activity in the first half of this year as well as some work that we did to sharpen certain areas of historical marketing investment. And as a result of that  demand creation investment was driving some leverage for us. Prior to COVID  we were at something like    or     of revenue  and it fell to about    in the first half. But what I mentioned on the last earnings call is that we don t think these are sustainable levels for demand creation as we look forward. And so given the speed of our recovery in the first half  our plan was to start accelerating investment back towards pre-pandemic levels. We won t get there in one quarter. We will get there over a period of time  but we believe that that s the right thing to do from a position of strength and given the size and scale of our brand and our recovery.,0.04422428831458092,NEUTRAL
So we had planned to spend more in the third quarter. But when we started to see the supply chain shifts occurring  we decided to shift some of that marketing investment into the fourth quarter in order to be able to balance and have those marketing investments occur at the time that the product was available in the marketplace. We re going to be accelerating investment in Q  against our biggest growth opportunities. Women s  we re going to continue to be investing internationally  as I mentioned  against   we re going to be investing behind Jordan. And we are going to continue to invest against digital. But we do believe longer term  Michael  that digital will be a source of leverage for us as we drive a greater return on ad spend and see more effectiveness in our full funnel marketing. And so that will be a source of leverage over time.,0.04831213038414717,NEUTRAL

Okay. Thanks for that. And then John  if I could ask one follow-up  you speak about the physical store strategy globally. It sounds like there is a lot of new interesting concepts. And I guess in North America  a market that grew up long ago is more of a wholesale model  and you ve made the biggest effort to transform the marketplace there. If the   I m curious how you see the segmentation effort as a lot of undifferentiated retailers come out of your business  but you still do have strategic partners through   with stores through the U.S. In the past  we ve seen you segment by House of Hoops  Track Club  the big installations at Dick s Sporting Goods  those kinds of things. How do you think about the next round of segmenting the market when  if you re going to be bringing more NIKE brand stores into the market now in a backdrop that has some of those wholesale partners still out there that are generating good business ,0.3047464843839407,POSITIVE
John Donahoe,0.0005607295388472266,NEUTRAL
Well  Michael  we start with the consumer  we start in every case with the consumer  and the consumer is really clear that they want to get what they want  when they want it  how they want it. And they want a seamless  premium digital and physical experience. In fact  in many cases  they don t see a difference between digital and physical  whether they bought it on digitally and had it delivered at home or whether they bought it digitally and picked it up in store  whether it was one of our stores or one of our strategic partner stores. And so we do see a need and a really important role for strategic physical presence  both ours and our partners. And the way we ll go forward is we are driving  starting with our own digital and our own stores  the seamless premium experience that s centered on the member  where we know who the member is. That member expects us to know who they are  whether they are in our stores or our partner stores. And so we ll work with a smaller number of strategic partners that see the same future we do and that want to and are willing to share membership data so that we can together deliver a very seamless experience  a very personalized experience for consumers. And the whole One Nike Marketplace will allow us to help consumers to get what they want  when they want it  how they want it. And so as we segment  it s   we re leaning in with those partners that see the world the same way we do. And those are the ones and the good news is they do. And the good news is those are the partners that have the most robust business with our shared consumers today. So the consolidation will continue. And again  I think you ll see even more movement from undifferentiated retail into a smaller number of   a smaller number of partners and our own stores that provide that seamless premium experience.,0.1623184708878398,NEUTRAL

Great  thanks. Good afternoon. John  for you  I was hoping you could speak a little bit more about the strength you ve seen in China  maybe a little bit on the consumer behavior as well as the product trends as that economy has picked up. Is there anything that you re looking or that you can learn from what you re seeing there for the rest of the world as we all open up  And then Matt  just for you  a clarification  would you be able to quantify kind of what you think the port miss was on North American segment in the quarter  Thank you.,0.42276004049926996,POSITIVE
John Donahoe,0.0005607295388472266,NEUTRAL
Well  Erinn  on China  it s just really clear  and it s sort of interesting. I m on my  I guess     month  but I so distinctly remember and fondly recall  my first week at NIKE was in China  as you recall  on the streets of Shanghai and Beijing  seeing the incredible connection that the Chinese consumer has with the NIKE  Jordan and Converse brands and frankly  seeing really high-quality physical retail to my prior   to the prior question  prior answer. The merchandising   these are all mono-brand stores  as you know  with us  our direct ones and our partners. And when you see what a outstanding physical merchandise experience can be and link that to a seamless digital experience  it s quite powerful. And we re probably furthest along in the world on that in China. And I will say that our Chinese team has just done a fabulous job in the past year of not just building a great business  but showing the way for other parts of the company. They obviously have done that through the pandemic being constantly   to   months ahead. Including today  being back at work side-by-side and the energy that comes with that  including today having physical retail open and seeing traffic getting close to historical levels. But they are also leading on that seamless experience. An example I ll highlight is just the one  I think Matt mentioned this in his remarks  on our new doors there  they are getting               of consumers in physical doors to either identify themselves as members or sign up and become members. And that allows that seamless experience for a consumer. So they are not   they are completely indifferent about whether they buy it  have it shipped to home  buy it online and pick it up in the store  whether within the store and they buy it and have it shipped home. And so I think that strong connection we have with consumers  brand-wise  but also that when we talk about the consistent premium  seamless experience  online to offline  that deliver consumers  we re furthest along. We re furthest along in China  and I give that team huge credit  and we re rapidly following that in our other geographies and regions.,0.30323202908039093,POSITIVE

I d maybe just jump in and say on the China piece that we continue to scale the Express Lane in China. And I referenced a couple of examples in the quarter related to Chinese New Year specific product. But we doubled the Express Lane in the quarter  and it continues to have significant impact  not only on localizing product but also   localizing product  but also speed and agility in the marketplace through our fulfillment models. And then Erinn  maybe one other indication vis- -vis China being ahead of other places  as the world has opened up  sport is returning. And so just the energy that we re seeing with sport returning  we re seeing our Performance business continue to grow significantly as well as our Kids business in that market  and it gives us a lot of optimism as we re looking ahead to reopening occurring in North America  Europe and other places. Specifically on your question about North America  what I would just say is we were on track to deliver our internal plans  and we were seeing momentum that was consistent with the type of momentum that we ve been seeing year-to-date as we are shifting  creating the marketplace shifts and continuing to lead with NIKE Direct and our strategic partners.,-0.11273905634880066,NEGATIVE

Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Hey  John  I wanted to follow-up on an interesting comment you made about merging art and science. And when you were talking about putting the data people alongside the creative people  maybe you could dive into that a little bit more. What your vision is and what areas are you applying data  Is it just customer analytics or is it in design and marketing and other areas  We d be really curious to see how you re doing that. And then my follow-up question is around women s. It kind of seems like a recurring theme. You guys are doing really well in a lot of areas in the women s business. What are the key drivers  What s the difference from the past  NIKE has been focused on women s a long time  but it seems to be inflecting.

Great  Omar. And Matt  why don t I take a cut of these and you can fill in. On   Omar  on data  data will ultimately improve our ability to deliver great experiences throughout our value chain. Now the most obvious place is at the consumer-facing front  right  So even in this quarter  we saw use of data to deliver more targeted communications to consumers and more personalized experience. And I would say  relative to what s possible  we re just scratching the surface there. So on that sort of consumer-facing side  data played a really   has played an important role and will continue to play an important role. The second area it plays an important role is one part of the consumer experience was getting the right product in the right place at the right time. And so this is where our select acquisition has allowed us to fairly impressively pivot to a more direct-to-consumer supply chain. And I  again  give our supply chain team enormous credit for what they have done over the last year as we have pivoted toward digital. But what that s all about is knowing what inventory to have resident in local regional warehouses so that you can get delivered more rapidly and often through ground transportation. By the way  both of those are scale games. The more data you have  if you re the leader and you have more scale  it allows you to deliver better experiences and have better efficiency. And as you described  data will ultimately also be able to help us do better design and create better products. Some of the people that are most excited in the company about what data and technology can do are John Hoke  our   who runs design  and Phil McCartney and Aaron Heiser  who run footwear and apparel. They are like with the data that we now have from our digital sites and that we can get from our consumer insights group  it just means that we can design footwear and apparel that s even more focused and more targeted on what the consumer wants.,0.30323978140950203,POSITIVE
And so I d say we re into our data journey  but there is so much more opportunity to come. And I think the entire company sees it and is excited about it. With respect to women s  the women s business is having a great momentum. It was the   I think eighth straight quarter where women s growth out indexed overall growth. And that s across both NIKE and Jordan Brand. And that had     growth in NIKE Digital. And physical retail  marketplace retail  grew to high double digits  and we re gaining share in women s  both on footwear and apparel. And while we re seeing success in women s to date  this move toward the consumer construct that we ve described with a real dedicated and focused women s team  means that we can increase our investment. So we ve doubled our investment in women s innovation over the past year  and that extends end-to-end. And so a wonderful example of what that can produce is what I referred to earlier  this React Escape. Because we launched it this quarter  this running shoe takes into account the physiological differences between male and female bodies. And so its silhouette  its materials  its design details are all aimed at the new female runner. And we think it s just a wonderful example of how we can take sharper insights and a greater focus end-to-end across our organization to really continue to turbocharge our women s business.,0.4097056433092803,POSITIVE
Matt Friend,0.013595406315289438,NEUTRAL
I would just add that some of the comments John made earlier as well just about our store strategy  the Nike Live concept is a is a concept that s intended to unlock significant growth in the women s marketplace. And we just   it would be hard  Omar  to size the opportunity because the women s market is so large. And we see the opportunity relative to where our business is penetrated today. And so while we continue to take share  those definitions are within the refinement of the way people define the market from an athletic footwear and athletic apparel in this. But what we re also seeing is athletic taking share of the broader women s marketplace. And so those are going to be fuel for growth for us as we continue to invest behind this exciting opportunity.,0.04967308044433594,NEUTRAL

Thanks so much. John  I think we ve talked on several calls about the investment in data and even on this one. And so I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the Datalogue acquisition  And then I think  Matt  on prior calls has talked about the margin advantage of digital. But it seems to me that there is some real P L benefits from the scaling of data. So if you kind of had to dream the dream  what do you think the opportunity is there  Thank you.,0.46956049534492195,POSITIVE
John Donahoe,0.0005607295388472266,NEUTRAL
Well  Matt  maybe I ll dream the dream around the consumer  and you can dream the dream around our income statement. I think they are very linked. Jamie  it s   I had to say we re just scratching the surface. I mean  so yes  Datalogue is our fourth data and analytics acquisition over the past couple of years. And they use machine learning to help automate  translating raw data into critical and actionable insights and doing it real-time at enterprise scale. And so as I said earlier  you re beginning to see whether it s improved and personalized search results  whether you re seeing more personalized recommendations of what if you bought this  you should buy this  if it s anticipating timing of when you re due for potentially some new footwear or some new apparel. Data just allows us to have a more personalized experience with consumers  and it s what consumers want and expect from a brand like NIKE  There are an awful lot of brands out there or platforms where they don t want people  they don t want people to know them well. NIKE is a brand and Jordan  where consumers want us to know them well and offer that even better experience. And then as you said and as I said a minute ago  almost across every step of our value chain  data enables us to  one  deliver the right product  right place  right time to that consumer. As I described earlier  and two  it drives efficiency and productivity. But our focus will be on the consumer. And that s one of the things that I think has always been a hallmark of NIKE is the consumer is absolutely at the center. And so we re going to prioritize that and continue to invest heavily in technology enablement and data. And as you said  scale matters. Scale matters because you get the most actionable data. This is   it s true in the technology industry. It s also true  I think  in our industry  and so we ll have a scale advantage in data. And it will drive both better consumer experience and efficiency. Matt  do you want to comment  add to that ,0.13132032379508018,NEUTRAL
Matt Friend,0.013595406315289438,NEUTRAL
Yes. So I ll dream the dream on the financial side of it. We think that  as I ve said for several quarters in a row  and Andy said before me  that the financial value of data and technology are significant for us. And we re already starting to see some of it  Jamie  in our current performance  but the opportunity in front of us is significant. It s being right more of the time. And where you ll see it drive financial value through our P L is making better pricing and merchandising decisions  where we place our inventory  how we choose to fulfill demand. All of those things will result in  and we see how a much more scientific and data-driven and machine learning approach to this is taking   is using human judgment with great analytics to enable us to make those decisions. And then I think more broadly as an enterprise  as we continue to automate the way we work and leverage technology end-to-end  there is going to be productivity in the manual processes and work that we do as a company today. And so I think you ll also see productivity in SG A over time as a result of us being able to leverage this type of capacity versus working in a more legacy type of fashion. And so we re investing heavily towards all of those opportunities.,0.18060364667326212,NEUTRAL

And Matt  I m going to just maybe add one final comment before we wrap up because I do want to   we ve had two  three data questions in a row  but as you said  Jamie  art and science. The science  the science of what we are doing  it s been done  it s doable. But the thing that makes this company remarkable is the art. It s the creativity of our apparel designers  of our footwear designers. It s the creativity of our brand teams and the storytelling they do and so data doesn t displace art. It s both. It s data and technology help enhance it and supplement it. But this   the core of this  the heart and soul of this company is an amazing wellspring of creativity and innovation and the mindset in everything we do. And so I just   this is going to make it a little bit more direct-to-consumer and make it a little bit more efficient. But we will never lose sight of the art of what NIKE  Jordan and Converse do.

Sure. Brad  this is John. With regards to the port issues  the only issues that we see is there s twofold  there s a lot of congestion coming out of Asia. And a lot of lack of containers. And then obviously the cost of moving containers is much higher than it was previously. But getting into the overall marketplace  Long Beach is definitely a challenge. But we definitely have some delays that we re working through  but we believe we re going to be in good shape and not have any real risks for the season  so that s the main take away from my perspective but we re definitely working diligently at that piece and we re moving our products as fast as we can.

The challenges are actually less than what they used to be is we re a lot cleaner. We don t have the challenges of top stocking  goods being stuck on the shelves for an extended period of time. So we re actually in a very good position to where the merchants have a lot of open-to-buy  ready-to-go and the stores can take it.

Yes  Rick  this is Jay. And I ll speak to that. I mean  I think obviously the board just authorized the increase in the stock buyback program by another      million. So  we ve got about      million out there      million of that expires in the relative near term. So  depending on what happens there  we ve really got      million that we re focused on. I think from a cash standpoint to run the business  we still do want to maintain some flexibility in liquidity.

Sure. with regards to   obviously we have always had that occur  but our smaller departments during the quarter would have been the toy category  candy  luggage  so from my perspective  toys was understandable. We actually had a real nice comp in Q . So  I think there was a pull forward of some of our toy sales during the year  people were shopping earlier.

Hey  good afternoon guys. Two questions  first follow-up on  I think  it might be some peers  question. Jay  you suggested to your stacks may be a framework for people to kind of think about for       but I think  when you start dealing with really large nominal numbers using stacks  it starts to distort the numbers a bit. So  could sales per store sales per square foot potentially be a better frame workforce for      ,-0.1748949959874153,NEGATIVE
Jay Stasz,-0.0004443664220161736,NEUTRAL
Yes  I mean  it s fair. We ve had that discussion Scott  after the last call a little bit. And to your point  right there is a certain level of when you look at stacks that the by store productivity maybe gets too low  especially when we re looking at certain quarters  like a Q  where we re going up against the       comp. I mean  that is still a huge comp to go against them. We re not going be able to match that,-0.07163494266569614,MIXED
That s why we kind of have gone to the      basis  that s kind of the last actual known that we have that s true. And if we grow that      you are going to get in the ballpark. We re not giving guidance  but that s kind of  we started to think of it for our base model kind of against      and expanding that top line by    . And we ve got the margin at the   .       . The SG A  we would expect to be more normalized  which is call it      maybe a little bit north of there.

Scot Ciccarelli,0.0001919519854709506,NEUTRAL
Yes  that s very helpful. And then thanks for all the deal flow commentary  but I guess one of the questions  I think  people are struggling with John is just  how is it you guys are seeing strong deal flow in categories  whether it s some of the home-related stuff you mentioned  sporting goods  et cetera. Most of us are hearing about product shortages in those categories. If you can just kind of connect those dots for people  I think  it d be really helpful for the investor base.,0.292198323411867,POSITIVE
John Swygert,3.873740206472576e-05,NEUTRAL
Yes  Scott  I think  this is the number one area that even Mark and I have been challenged ever since we ve gone public to get people to understand how we make a living. We ve been doing this for    years. So  we have long-standing relationships with a lot of vendors. Well  over a thousand different vendors. There s always going to be close outs regardless of what people think and how they view the world  there s package change  there s obsolescence that happens  there s shelf pools. I mentioned this a few calls ago that close outs could create in many different ways  just as there may be shortages of the inline product  it doesn t mean there s not close out availability. Close out availability will exist all the time  good times and bad times. It s just the way it works.,0.21260705962777138,POSITIVE
Stuff that may be short dated. Short dated for Target and Walmart might be    months. Short dated for us is probably    days. So  there s a big difference in terms of where that product can go from the CPG company. So  there s a gamut of reasons things become available  or people cancel orders. But I can tell you with a hundred percent confidence  our buyers are flushed with goods. They are not having a hard time finding product  and we re not having any type of misses. We re not changing category mix to make things work better for us. We re buying the categories that we have always bought and we ll continue what we re doing. We have not changed our business strategy one bit.,-0.19903523474931717,NEGATIVE

So  from a retail perspective  I d say you probably think we re slow turner. We re lean from what we used to do  but I think we re right where we are. So  I think reducing the levels from where we were previously is  we re spot on where we d like to be.

Yes Jason  as we would always tell you we do buys every day. And the workwear category is a buy we do each and every year. The one that you re talking about was a special buyout from a bankruptcy that occurred. So  we do it each and every year  just like the wedding dresses. So  it s a bankruptcy buyout. We do a ton of this. This is just our model. So  we re working on another deal right now that s related to that same organization. That ll come in here probably the next month into our stores.

With regards to changing our overall strategy to more clothing  absolutely not. That is of low interest to us. We re going to buy clothes outs to put them in the stores.

We don t like fashion risk  and that s not what we do. We re really more of a hardline retailer.

Yes Jeremy  I can t give too much color. But I can give you directionally where we saw last year. Obviously when the economy closed down  I think  it was March    of last year.

So  the second question I wanted to ask was Ollie s Army week versus a single night in Q . And  just wanted to see if you could provide some additional color on how you felt that performed. Obviously  I think  this wasn t unusual holiday season where a lot of buying was pulled forward. But you clearly saw  pretty good performance obviously in January  but maybe December turned out better than November was. So  I wanted to see if you could provide some color on that week. And then as we think forward to Q  this year  is that something where maybe it s going to be Ollie s Army week going forward instead of a single night.,-0.014932975172996521,MIXED
Jay Stasz,-0.0004443664220161736,NEUTRAL
Right. Jeremy  this is Jay. Yes  we were pleased with our holiday season. Like you said  we didn t participate in a lot of the early sales that were happening in November. It seems like people really started Black Friday early. But our November   at the time we announced low single digits and December was stronger than that. Our holiday period  for those two months together was in the mid-single digits. So  we were pleased with that. And then to your point  January was very strong with the stimulus that came in that month.,0.48689408000791445,POSITIVE
And as far as Ollie s Army week versus Ollie s Army night  the week  itself was probably flattish a little bit down to the year ago period. And part of that was because in the prior year  we aim to actually ran a     of Toys promotion for the public  not only the army  but anybody that came in the store.,-0.14198933728039265,NEUTRAL
So  from a top-line standpoint  we are actually a little bit negative on the week from a margin standpoint  because we were less promotional. It was beneficial. So  that is the week.,0.10100109875202179,MIXED
Next year or this year  I guess  looking forward to Ollie s Army night  our leaning is that we would go back to the one night. We kind of like the excitement and the buzz that it generates for the customer to come in. And it s just kind of a tradition and a longstanding event that creates a lot of excitement  both for our stores and our shoppers  most importantly. So  we re leaning towards the one night going back to that.,0.44788973667891696,POSITIVE
John Swygert,3.873740206472576e-05,NEUTRAL
Yes  Jeremy  the only caveat to that is if there s still issues with COVID and restrictions on number of people in the store and whatnot  then we d have to adjust accordingly. But we ll see where we re at what time to make that decision.,-0.0069794002920389175,MIXED

John Swygert,3.873740206472576e-05,NEUTRAL
Yes  Anthony  we re going to open up in three new states this year  as I said earlier  Kansas  Missouri and Vermont. In terms of backfilling and existing versus new markets  I would tell you  we re probably going to do     or     in existing markets and the rest comes in the newer markets. I wouldn t say new markets  but we re still infants in the state of Texas  we re still infants in Oklahoma. We re still  back-filling some of the newer states.,0.06896591931581497,NEUTRAL
But overall  if you   literally speaking  if you want to look at Kansas  Vermont and Missouri  that s probably only a handful of stores. So  most of that would come in existing states that we re in.

And so how has that changed if at all ,-0.26718249171972275,NEGATIVE
John Swygert,3.873740206472576e-05,NEUTRAL
Yes  definitely a good question  Anthony. Last year  once COVID hit  we never ran any grand opening campaigns in the stores during the heavy period of the pandemic. So  we basically just did regular flyers and opened the stores very quietly. We never called them grand openings  because we couldn t afford to have that many people in the stores at one time. But what we did see  which was interesting is we still got the traction in the stores it may not happen in that one day  but it still happened pretty quickly where the store has still performed very  very well. And I think we learned a little bit about how we can open stores and we don t have to spend as much in advertising as it may have done historically.,0.4736833032220602,POSITIVE

So again  we re kind of from a base framework  we re going back to the      actuals and growing the topline  two years  worth of growth. So  call it    . So that gives you a topline.

For our OTCQB market we continue to see more than     of companies renewing at the end of their service terms.,0.03586655738763511,NEUTRAL
Turning to expenses  on a quarter-over-quarter basis operating expenses increased by     the primary driver was a     increase in professional and consulting fees in part due to an increase in clearing and regulatory compliance fees which are related to the elevated volume of trading activity on our OTC Link ECN. Compensation and IT infrastructure costs also contributed to the increase partially offset by a decline in marketing and occupancy expenses.,-0.003954862244427204,NEUTRAL
The increase in compensation costs reflects the impact of higher headcount  annual salary increases as well as an increase in cash and equity based incentive compensation related to our performance. On a year-over-year basis operating expenses were up    driven by growth in compensation costs  professional and consulting fees and depreciation and amortization offset by decline in marketing occupancy cost and general and administrative expenses.,0.0003477171412669122,NEUTRAL
Compensation comprised about     of our total expense base in     . In summary  we concluded      as our   th consecutive quarter of revenue growth.

Good morning  thanks for taking my questions. Nice quarter and Antonio congratulations on joining the team. I just wanted to start with OTC Link - we obviously really great in the quarter. We talked in the past about kind of you got a certain amount or a finite amount of growth to go after there ,0.488582220103126,POSITIVE
I guess can you just talk about where you re at in terms of the market share  the gains on market share where that can go from here  And then also  I think you announced also the NQB how does that change. Does that open up additional market share opportunities with Link you could just help me with that a little bit  Thanks.,0.014479687437415123,NEUTRAL

Sure  thanks Chris. This is Dan and maybe Cromwell you want to answer the first part of that question.,0.1784134842455387,NEUTRAL
Cromwell Coulson,0.00029685403569601476,NEUTRAL
Yes  so Chris  thank you for that question. I look at it is the impressive part volumes are something we don t fully control in the market. But what s been more impressive is the continuing subscriber  the subscriber growth for OTC Link ECN. And that is something that the team did a fantastic job throughout      and has continued to do that. And then  you can take a look at a limited functionality for a certain type of trade.,0.4926542922476074,POSITIVE
But going into the space of the anonymous matching engine model which is a tool to access liquidity and deliver best execution the broker-dealer desire  is what the other tools for us to add on top of that. And this skill set in this space is and the ability to on-board new clients is a skill set that if we have a strong P  and we can deliver. And this is really important technology to broker dealers at a competitive cost  because both in the exchange phase and some other ATS  in non-equity assets. The things are pretty expensive.,0.14484877628274262,NEUTRAL
So if we re good at being a cost effective  very useful client focused vendor  we ll find opportunities. On NCB  it s - there is restrictions on how we can distribute our quote data if we re anonymous ECN  OTC Link. So it s a third business model which is electronic match  electronic  Autolex  of orders  but fully disclosed. And that creates a data feed for us which makes our models better because we re putting the data out further and wider the depth of book not just the inside.,0.10144248232245445,NEUTRAL
And it creates some system reliability resilience. And it gives a third model for broker-dealers who want to be fully disclosed  but don t want to put more liquidity on top of the execution. And what you really need to understand is  different broker dealers have different needs based on their business model.,0.31957301730290055,POSITIVE

I appreciate that  that s very helpful. And I guess just turning to   c -    and it s like - to support initiatives  you re going to have to invest a little bit. Is that correct in kind of reading what you ve put in the annual report that - do you need to make a bigger investment this year to support changes around   c -   ,0.34888538741506636,POSITIVE
And then  I guess just what are the opportunities  are you excited about on-boarding newer companies coming onto your markets or has this made you think about maybe investing in other areas of the business to maybe support growth if some of it hit. Can you just walk me through that a little bit ,0.0021224431693553925,MIXED
Cromwell Coulson,0.00029685403569601476,NEUTRAL
Well    c -   is the big transformation in     . And it takes us from offering a regulated trading platform business under Reg ATS. And having market data  which investors and brokers use to analyze value and trade securities and our corporate services business  which has been market-driven. We built that whole business based on companies wanting to step-up and really own their trading to provide the information out there.,0.06693177984561771,NEUTRAL
So  investors are informed and brokers can best most efficiently trade securities. However  the markets move forward in   c -   has recognized that we are the ones in the OTC market who set the standard for monitoring what level of disclosure and compliance and governance companies put out there. And this has been recognized  has been continually recognized by the states as they recognized just for Blue Sky.,0.04369125980883837,NEUTRAL
So there s one part that s really important is  we are moving to be seen as the entity that broker dealers can rely on for monitoring ongoing disclosure by issuers that there s current information as publicly available and ongoing and that s important. The second side is that it is because for the monitoring piece  the ongoing disclosure we re about halfway there. The market recognized it and then the regulators are catching up is that the onboarding is - exciting.,0.06802414543926716,NEUTRAL
It is really painful and complicated to bring a company onto our markets because you had a broker dealer filing a     and with FINRA  the FINRA information was hidden - in FINRA investors didn t see it. And it s a change to what really should be done today is making sure that there s adequate current information publicly available when a security industry is trading. So it s a big piece for us to one  create the regulatory compliance infrastructure.,-0.3031460577622056,NEGATIVE
But on the other side is  where s the commercial value  because today when a company would become trade at OTC. There wasn t a great ability for other broker dealers to see the information or understand the level of compliance  the financial strength  what - the securities issuance history  all - these pieces of information that brokers need to trade a security and put it out into the market.,-0.36887909565120935,NEGATIVE
And so  what we look at is   c -   is providing the regulatory foundation for changing how companies can go public on our markets.

Andrew Mitchell,0.000174310669535771,NEUTRAL
Thank you very much. And can I just follow-up again on a couple of those regulations  like regulatory points. I was wondering if you have any indication of potential timing for approval of the expert market given the September compliance date ,0.3791709430515766,POSITIVE
And then on the consolidated audit trail  that I think next phase  that becomes effective in April. And on both those fronts  I mean can you give any sort of indication in terms of the cost side for the GCM for implementation yet ,-0.022725258022546768,NEUTRAL
Cromwell Coulson,0.00029685403569601476,NEUTRAL
Sure  thanks  Andrew. So  I ll  I ll start with experts. You may have seen the SEC put out a proposed conditional exemption towards the end of      to the expert market with a comment period attached to it. We and several others commented on it and all of  everything in the comment file very positive. That comment file closed about a month ago. And so  we continue to talk to the SEC about it. We are anxious to see it get approved.,0.16596576012670994,NEUTRAL
But it s - we understand as a commission is in flux a little bit right now  with again they re still going through the confirmation proceedings in order to potentially the SEC chair. And so  we d love to see it happen any day now  but do understand that there are other considerations within the commission. The best thing I can say is we have a really good open line of communication with the staff there.,0.1350156283006072,MIXED
And so  we re constantly getting feedback and providing as much information as we can. And we re hopeful that it gets approved sooner rather than later. But we ll certainly be the ones shouting from the mountaintops when it comes out  so we won t be shy about it at all. With respect to CAT  the next phase is to see if CAT becomes effective in April. But CAT has been around for a while and it s only been talked about for a decade  if not longer.,0.010350164026021957,MIXED
And so  the implementation that we focus on is really about supporting our subscribers and their ability to meet their CAT reporting requirements that s something we continue to do. We re meeting with and talking to our subscribers pretty regularly. So it s not about sudden costs  so much as the longer-term plan that we ve had in place and the industry has had in place. And similarly it s the same refrain there where we continue to talk to FINRA and the other SROs and the SEC about the ways to right-size how CAT works for our market like ours.,0.05378941260278225,NEUTRAL
We know that we have a unique market model  and that people haven t necessarily considered it in developing things like CAT that started so many years ago. And so  just working to make sure that they are considering all the unique aspect of our market structure  is really the core and the key sort of initiative we have with respect to CAT.,0.07183158799307421,NEUTRAL
Andrew Mitchell,0.000174310669535771,NEUTRAL
Okay great. Thanks very much. And then on the question on the elevated trading volumes you ve referenced. I wonder if you are able to or there is an estimate of how important retail investors are within that. Obviously  you ve seen a big increase in terms of the market data size  but just wondering on the trading size  how much the high trading volume levels would you say are arising from the retail market ,0.30774625577032566,POSITIVE
Cromwell Coulson,0.00029685403569601476,NEUTRAL
So Andrew  the way I look at trading volume is it s something we don t control. We have a diverse group of securities. I mean people pay OTC with low price securities. A lot of the retail speculation has actually been on NYSE and NASDAQ Securities  GameStop  AMC  Hertz. So  and this isn t to say that we don t have those same forces going through. And the debate within the industry is really not is this  a peak volume  but has the floor gone up.,-0.2065213844180107,NEUTRAL
And has there been more interest in stocks over time and will - and how will  that stay and how will that transform that as investors get smarter. Investors that make mistakes will then be smarter and then they ll seek out other opportunities. They ll do more research. They ll learn like every investors coming to the market. The most successful investors I ve ever met have  they talk about their history as early investors of not great  making great investments and then using that to learn and get better.,0.2619250491261482,POSITIVE
So  we look at it as - the volumes are fantastic. However  and then however  we want to last through both the good market cycles and the bad market cycles. And we built our business around it and we have transaction on subscription business. But our goal is to really keep improving the platform and keep increasing the capabilities for clients  and fulfilling our mission to create more efficient and better informed financial markets.,0.265235475031659,POSITIVE
Andrew Mitchell,0.000174310669535771,NEUTRAL
Okay - and following on from that neatly - is the point about the system s reliability and - that s one of your key points for the current year. But just wondering if that - does that involve higher CapEx than one might have expected prior to the exceptional volumes that have been going on or is that something which - you re still behaving as a more normal level of investment in the current year ,0.005699958652257919,MIXED
Cromwell Coulson,0.00029685403569601476,NEUTRAL
Well Andrew  I mean we re going to invest where we need to provide the quality of service that our clients demand of us.

That said  we re careful and thoughtful - about when we make our capital spending and when we make our add costs to the business. So it s - we don t try to manage quarter-to-quarter or year-to-year.,0.10317766852676868,NEUTRAL
I mean I think you saw that in       we took our expenses up to invest in areas and in       we were more careful and we really focused on having the team and the platform that we had you know is running the business. And so that cycle is  we re going to try and be very thoughtful to think about how do  we have a platform and a company and a level of service that has the right amount of investment to come out of every year better than where it started.,0.29579999716952443,POSITIVE

Great  thanks. And if I may  just one final - question just on the M A point. Am I still right to think that your focus really is on incremental rather than again - realize your focus is more organic this year. But looking further out  you could be looking for more incremental acquisitions rather than seeking a larger transformational acquisition ,0.3516464326530695,POSITIVE

Well Andrew  I mean I think in the lifecycle of our business is that we haven t - we ve been incremental  we ve been an organic growth story.

Yes  I would also say that we re seeing a lot of customers who have had to really shift their business like a large coffee retailer you might know of  where mobile pickup and pay has become really important. That s a pandemic-driven shift  but it s here to stay. And that kind of dependence on digital assets becomes another tailwind for us.

And then if we take the sort of reacceleration in the dollar retention  and we think about pricing impacts and we think about concessions you ve given and the loyalty you ve talked about  Jennifer and Howard  about customers  indiscernible  come back  are we starting to see that play out  Was this because of the large deals that we saw in that dollar retention and the expansions come in  Help us balance those two out  Is it   are we getting passive  You ve seen some early green shoots  but was this because of billings and expansions that drove the net dollar retention rate improvement or a combination  or if you could piece that out for us that would be really helpful  I think.,-0.1675366833806038,NEGATIVE
Howard Wilson,0.00016406064969487488,NEUTRAL
Sure. So -- and Jen may have some comments on this  too. I think the way that I would characterize it is our strength in enterprise is well-established. And we continue to see large customers within the enterprise expand with us. And so it s now become quite predictable that we ll have about one-third of our customers  enterprise customers expand with us each quarter. We saw some spend contracting in the early days of the pandemic. But certainly  today  we re seeing that more of that pre-COVID like demand is back  right  And so those customers are expanding with us. And that s contributing to the good net-net dollar retention rate. However  across all of our segments  we re seeing positive movement. It s not exclusively in the enterprise. Enterprise is above       but we re seeing healthy expansion happening in all of our segments today.,0.059918202459812164,NEUTRAL
Jennifer Tejada,0.0010443444189149886,NEUTRAL
Yeah. I d add to that that the success that we re having with the digital operations platform is really driving user expansion within large customers within our base. And I think our customers have learned that  that Clydesdale rule applies that with PagerDuty s ROI  as you add more users that ROI scales exponentially. Likewise  users recognize that the more users on the platform  the easier their job is.,0.11735949106514454,NEUTRAL
So we re starting to see that network effect at scale. And that makes a meaningful difference. I also -- I just want to recognize our teams again because you look at mid-market  setting a pretty significant record on the number of transactions  their transaction growth over the quarter. I love it when I see that because that s the nature of our hybrid go-to-market model at work where you re doing high velocity transactions  and at the same time still able to do large expansions in enterprise  and Dave and his leadership team have done a great job there.,0.36258483200799674,POSITIVE

Hey  Jennifer and Howard  thank you so much for taking my questions. Great to see the reacceleration in the business. Jennifer  I want to go to a comment you made in response to Matt s question at the very beginning  which is that you re confident that you can get your growth into the   s  not going to hold you to that as guidance. I think that s a great aspirational goal.,0.49355744662170764,POSITIVE
Jennifer Tejada,0.0010443444189149886,NEUTRAL
Thank you.,0.49911520398018183,POSITIVE
Rishi Jaluria,0.00166233628988266,NEUTRAL
But maybe if you could help us understand  what is it that you re seeing that s giving you confidence in that as a reasonable target  And maybe  how should we be thinking about the drivers to achieve there  is that just a bounce back and macro  is that relying on more growth in these non-core use cases  where you re talking about security and customer support  and then maybe some that we re not even talking about today that we might be talking about a year from now  Maybe let s drill into that. And then I have a follow-up for Howard.,-0.2563972333446145,NEGATIVE
Jennifer Tejada,0.0010443444189149886,NEUTRAL
It s definitely a combination of things. I think strengthen -- when we went public actually  we talked about multiple engines for growth. And I think we really delivered on that mindset  our new product  if you look at digital -- ARR from digital operations management  like that s doubled from that plan  our regional growth is up    . So we re starting to see the new  our new investments in EMEA and APJ come online  user growth s up    .,0.3064363590674475,POSITIVE
And then we re really starting to see traction in some of the most  I think  sensible adjacent use cases like security and customer service  but we re also seeing user expansion drive new used cases that we don t even track. So those growth engines are working the way we intended them to. We re executing better from a go-to-market perspective. And I do think the macro is improving and its improving in a way that s favorable to us because remember we don t have a bunch of pull-forward revenue from COVID  rather what we re seeing is as customers get into either recovery mode as they have gotten about managing remote work and they have made that transition to digital  they are making more strategic investments. Our sales teams have given us feedback that they are just seeing many more transformative deals as opposed to tactical deals.,0.14842672646045685,POSITIVE
Secondly  as some of the rest of the market recovers  we expect to see them start to invest like they did potentially pre-COVID or even more than they were investing during COVID because they are now more reliant on the digital environment.,-0.14088082406669855,NEUTRAL
And so I think reopening -- and even hybrid work is a bit of a tailwind for us because when -- right now  when everybody is working at home  it works really well. You know where everybody is. As soon as half the company is in offices and half the company s remote somewhere you can t find them  that those teams feel even more distributed and PageDuty was built for that.,-0.12905843555927277,NEGATIVE
So  I think we re going to continue to pull away from the competition like we have been the last couple of years  and that also bodes well for us. But I just -- I like how it s all coming together. It s probably a really good way to put it.,0.42780080589000136,POSITIVE
Rishi Jaluria,0.00166233628988266,NEUTRAL
Fantastic. That s great to hear. And then  Howard  I wanted to drill a little bit more into the margin guidance for next year. You are talking about margins declining pretty meaningfully. Maybe you can you tell us -- where are you seeing these -- what do you -- what are the high priorities for the incremental investments  And maybe you did touch on this in the prepared remarks  but you obviously expect some bounce back of COVID-related savings as travel becomes a little bit more reasonable than expectation. Can you maybe talk about how much of those costs are coming back and what your assumptions baked into that margin guidance are  And maybe alongside that  just overall  have you turned the corner on at least being sustainably free cash flow positive on a full year basis  Thanks.,0.1769854724407196,POSITIVE
Howard Wilson,0.00016406064969487488,NEUTRAL
Sure. So  I would probably unpack it this way  Rishi. When we look at our operating margin  you have identified some of the elements correctly. There was a certain amount of savings that we got this past year related to COVID. But then there were also some proactive measures we put in place as last year in light of the macroeconomic uncertainty  where we slowed down certain parts of our activity  intentionally  like things like hiring because whilst we wanted to get a better understanding of what was happening in the environment.,-0.025548968464136124,MIXED
So  now that we are seeing our execution operating so well  our view is that we can take a far more progressive view on investment into this next year. So  what that means is  one  we ll have Rundeck  which will be with us for the full year  and we have significant investment in Rundeck through this next year. So that has an impact  which we spoke about at the time of the acquisition.,0.10953805124154314,NEUTRAL
The second is that we re planning to accelerate our investment in engineering because we believe that from an innovation perspective  we ve delivered a huge amount of value to our customer base within this last year  but it s not yet done. We have a number of initiatives such as the European data hosting  which is another initiative that is kind of additive to what we re doing.,0.04601477459073067,NEUTRAL
So  when you add all of those together  our view is that this is the right time for us to continue to invest in the business to continue to invest in go-to-market because the demand is clearly there. And that s why we framed our thinking around operating margin in that     to     range -- or operating loss      to    .,0.09910937398672104,NEUTRAL
Jennifer Tejada,0.0010443444189149886,NEUTRAL
I would just add to that. When you look at the solid performance on unit economics for the business and also you look at how early we are in this transition  the total addressable market  that gives us confidence to continue to invest in growth  particularly around product innovation because that s where we re demonstrating a number of competitive moats that I think we can build upon.,0.10421555885113776,NEUTRAL
Howard Wilson,0.00016406064969487488,NEUTRAL
We were -- the prior year  we were at negative    operating margin. We improved to negative   this year. We ve demonstrated our ability to be able to make that progress. So we will continue to be prudent in how we manage those things. And pure comment on operating cash flow  clearly its always been a goal for us to be sustainably cash flow positive.,0.28911399142816663,POSITIVE
We have a few things that are happening this year  like the payments related to the Rundeck acquisition and the full interest payments from the capital raise we did last year that are going to mean that some quarters we won t be  but we will continue to be working to be sustainably cash flow positive.,0.07157304044812918,NEUTRAL

Derrick Wood,0.0009525197092443705,NEUTRAL
Long time listener  first time caller. So  thanks for taking my questions. First  you guys rolled out some new pricing and packaging recently  and I wanted to ask about   things. First  on the free tier  we d love to hear how that s helping build a new customer funnel and whether you see trade downs or that s really just about new funnel generation ,0.4367927028797567,POSITIVE
And then second  on the simplification of the SKUs and just would love to hear the dividends from that and how you expect that to impact the model  specifically net revenue retention rates heading into the New Year ,0.1603294536471367,POSITIVE
Jennifer Tejada,0.0010443444189149886,NEUTRAL
Well  I ll kick off by talking a little bit about free and then Howard can jump in and talk about pricing. On free  that s been a really important new offer for us to try and stimulate trial and more activity in the top of the funnel  and that s going well. When you look at our new accounts  both free and paid  that s up     year-over-year. So we like the momentum that we re seeing there.,0.4038917380385101,POSITIVE
Free has also given us an opportunity to invest in long-term relationships with our small businesses who really struggled this year to find OpEx to invest in things. So it s helped us  I think  to continue to keep some of those customer relationships engaged. And frankly  it reduces friction for trial. So it s bringing more users on to the platform  which we have  I think  a good track record in converting.,0.4646656627592165,POSITIVE
So it s still very early days as an experiment for us. But again  kind of we like what we re seeing there. And we re seeing it helpful across all of our segments  not just small business and very small business. And I think with Sean Scott here  you should expect to see us try and build more functionality  more discovery  more capability in the early use of our product  the trial experience  how our customers discover us  how they discover new products  et cetera. Howard  do you want to talk about pricing ,0.40564284194260836,POSITIVE
Howard Wilson,0.00016406064969487488,NEUTRAL
Yes. And I would add to that  I think the simplification that we did on our pricing structure and our plans has yielded benefits almost immediately because it s made it easier for customers to buy. So the selection process of which plan they should take  they re no longer confounded by is this plan with this option. The simplicity in that has made it easier for them to progress through the tiers. And I think that s part of why we ve seen people make the choice around our digital operations plan because it s very clear the value they re going to get into it  and we ve made it easy for them to buy.,0.4406567191472277,POSITIVE
Derrick Wood,0.0009525197092443705,NEUTRAL
Great  thanks for the color. If I could squeeze one more in  So you guys have a new product geared for customer service  specifically. Can you just explain how that s different from the core  And maybe  how you ll kind of be more strategic around trying to sell that in the New Year  Will there be a dedicated sales force  or how do you plan to take that to market ,0.4850427855271846,POSITIVE
Jennifer Tejada,0.0010443444189149886,NEUTRAL
Sure. I ll take that. We actually have one of our executives leading a dedicated business unit around customer service  so really starting to focus on that. And if you think about it  the platforms and products that customer service agents work in are very different from the products and services that developers and IT organizations use.,0.02301166206598282,NEUTRAL
So our customer service offering really started with deep integrations into products like Salesforce Service Cloud and Zendesk. And we just saw a lot of uptake in when we built those integrations  and we sort of started there and then started to add feature sets.,0.20769564877264202,NEUTRAL
And if you think about it  case management. So customer -- inbound customer case management is very similar to incident management. But as businesses have become more digital  the urgency  the sort of real-time operations challenge has become a lot harder for a customer -- for our customers  because they have less time before a customer will start shouting on Twitter or Reddit or getting angry or wherever they re going to get angry. They don t call and wait on the  -    line for you to patiently express what s going on.,-0.398254408268258,NEGATIVE
And so  the challenge for these service agents is  they need to get to the developers in the organization  the IT team  the security team  et cetera. And historically  those teams are all on different platforms. What PagerDuty does really well is orchestrate that effort across teams  across platforms  without the agent needing to leave the context of the environment that they re in. So huge time savings  huge productivity savings  and they re able to get the attention of dev and IT very quickly to solve some of these problems.,0.05250336602330208,NEUTRAL
Likewise  they re able to talk to agents intelligently about what s actually going on  how long it will take to resolve something  et cetera  so able to give better information to service agents as well. So that s -- these are sort of early days. There are some additional use cases that we re working on or serving  but that s kind of the starting point.,-0.018488451838493347,MIXED

Sterling Auty,-0.01156417466700077,NEUTRAL
I was just going to hide my video  I was hiding from -- so  guys  I think you ve given some of the breadcrumbs to answer part of this  but I want to make sure I fully understand. When you look at the success that you had in the enterprise segment  in particular  and in the quarter  how much of that was coming from expansion in existing customers  which we saw in the net dollar retention versus how much of that is actually bringing on new enterprise customers in the quarter  that might be a result of some of the improved sales execution ,-0.0801985114812851,NEUTRAL
Owen Wilson,-8.405707194469869e-05,NEUTRAL
So  Sterling  it is a combination of both. We definitely saw good expansion in the enterprise. The enterprise segment now covers more than     of our revenues. And so we certainly saw good expansion  which shows up in the dollar-based net retention rate. But we ve also been pleased with the customer acquisition that we re seeing in the enterprise and the mid-market segment.,0.49658939120854484,POSITIVE
So we ve been bringing on -- and much in our land and expand model that we ve spoken about for a few years  we ve been bringing on enterprises  and they re starting with us small in teams and then growing into those cohorts of the          and          and    million.,0.027088736882433295,NEUTRAL
Sterling Auty,-0.01156417466700077,NEUTRAL
And then  just maybe as a follow-up  Jennifer  as you think about that  why not  What is it that these enterprises -- is it just they re giving up on in-house solutions that maybe they were trying to use  Is it that it s clear that you separated from the competition  What are the major   and I m sure there s a number of them  but what would you say are the one or two things that are causing enterprises to choose you now ,-0.277183560654521,NEGATIVE
Jennifer Tejada,0.0010443444189149886,NEUTRAL
It s definitely a couple of things. It s definitely the digitization of these business models  creating a sense of urgency to figure out how to make all the complex technology that sits underneath  their brand engagement  their end consumer engagement  their employee engagement  right  And I think COVID taught many leaders  not just technical leaders  but CEOs that when   that digital is care to stay  and it s driving the majority of your business now  not the minority part of your business. And so you ve got to get that right.,0.18186401715502143,NEUTRAL
The second thing is  I think we ve just made it clear that we are the only and the best solution for real-time ops  for digital ops and enterprise. There s just nobody who s come close to proving their resiliency and their scale at our level in a way that developers will not only adopt but drive virally across the organization.,0.1322096437215805,NEUTRAL
And then there s one other trend that I don t think we talk about enough  which is leadership in these large enterprises are increasingly more technical. So you re seeing large traditional companies hire cloud executives from Amazon  right  and Google  et cetera. So you re finding CTOs and CIOs that are developers  like we re coders  we have carried the pager  like really understand the value of not just our first use case  but automating and preventing incidents by using data and machine learning.,-0.1985683748498559,NEUTRAL
So it s just more of an open mind towards adopting some of our newer solutions. And that s probably the thing that I ve been the most excited about. When you look at the customers spending over    million  growing by      that s because they re not like crawling  walking and running. They re putting together a transformative relationship with us from the start. And then the growth comes as they add users and teams and bring them on board.,0.3298282870091498,POSITIVE

Well  thank you. Congrats on Q . And really  thank you for all the great metrics this quarter. A lot of things stand out. I think Event Intelligence being up      was a particular standout. And I guess my question for you  Jen  is going back to the IPO  you re really clear with us on what the marching orders for the company was  which was to move upmarket and  frankly  be able to monetize your technology lead relative to customers. And I guess it s been the theme of this call so far  but along the dimensions of sales cycles  deal sizes  how often customers sort of haggle with you on price  where are you today versus    months ago     months ago  when we re sort of really starting that journey ,0.4744269334478304,POSITIVE
Jennifer Tejada,0.0010443444189149886,NEUTRAL
I m really proud of the balance that we ve struck there. We always talked about our hybrid go-to-market model  the fact that we   our land motion is e-commerce-driven  and then our expand motion starts out as transactional and very short sales cycles  a lot of deals created and closed in the quarter. But then as we ve gotten into more strategic relationships  where you ve got thousands or tens of thousands of users inside a Fortune     company  they want a partner to support them.,0.37105054315179586,POSITIVE
They want strategic customer success. They want professional services. They want an experienced account executive to help them. And I think Dave and the team have done a great job of bringing that to lay for us without damaging the velocity of the flywheel at the same token. So like we won t dive in deep into the funnel to get hands on something that can grow on its own. So that s one thing I m really proud of.,0.42929221119266003,POSITIVE
The second thing is I think the product team has really struck the balance between getting new features to market  but also continuing to add robust services and important reliability and resiliency investments to the platform so that we can support the largest customers in the world  the most innovative customers in the world in doing what they need to do at the pace they need to do it  right  And so one of the challenges that you have as you grow in enterprise size and I ve seen this in my career is you get a lot of customer requests. And they re not always request you re going to want to build for the rest of the market  so you ve really got to strike that balance. And the product team has worked really hard to be in the market  listening to our largest customers  but also making sure that when we build something  it s going to engage our entire user community  not a couple of large customers that have a corner case. So I think that s been good.,-0.09122395515441895,MIXED
I also think that there is a recognition around our ROI and our payback and our time to value. So it s not a three-year problem to figure out whether the investment you made in PagerDuty is going to pay off. It s a two-month payback. It s an      ROI over three years. And that -- like we get those numbers from our customers. IDC audited those numbers. So when you see that  it becomes a much easier conversation as the quantifiable value prop becomes more obvious. And we ve gotten better at having that conversation with customers as we ve grown up  for sure.,0.08652793988585472,NEUTRAL
And then the last thing that I would say is  we re still being chosen by the most innovative startups on the planet. So if you look at where the developer community looks for influence  we re still the first choice there. The market has been very concerned over competition for a very long time and every quarter  we prove that  that is not an issue for us  and we re going to continue to prove that until it doesn t come up anymore.,-0.15527167916297913,NEGATIVE
Sanjit Singh,-0.00813007727265358,NEUTRAL
It s coming up less and less  so that s definitely a good sign. As a follow-up question  I wanted to ask about what s going on in security  because it seems like that market is evolving  kind of  like cloud and the DevOps movement gave rise to observability and automated incident response. It seems like cloud security is on a similar track  and we ve seen a lot of M A  security guys requiring log analytics vendors to do that convergence for the SOP team. And so I m wondering to think about how you were thinking about the security operations team and what your roadmap and your ability to serve those sets of users as they lean into the cloud at a much more accelerated pace coming out of the crisis ,0.10248645395040512,NEUTRAL
Jennifer Tejada,0.0010443444189149886,NEUTRAL
We already serve SecOps teams very well. We don t market ourselves very well in that regard. But we already serve SecOps teams very well  because if you think about it  responding to a security breach or a potential threat is the best version of incident response. It s the best example of why it s mission-critical  why it s time-sensitive  how unpredictable it is and how often unstructured it is  and the only way you resolve a situation like a breach to data leak  a potential threat  et cetera  is to orchestrate very detailed troubleshooting and work across multiple teams across the organization  and PagerDuty already does that.,0.16951497457921505,POSITIVE
The other thing that we re seeing is developers largely comprise SecOp teams  so they already have a PagerDuty experience that s been positive. It s often a developer who moves into security that brings us in  et cetera.,0.037356503307819366,NEUTRAL
And if you -- and then the last thing that I would say is when you look at Event Intelligence and what we ve done with digital operations management  it is about really finding signal in the noise. As these events are coming through  those integration investments that we ve made to the security stack  the threat management stack  et cetera  have been really important in diligencing is this a technology issue  is it a security issue  is it a data issue  et cetera. So  -- and I guess one final thing I would say is the security team and the dev team need to work really effectively together. And ITSM products do not serve the urgent nature of something that is happening right now that could be business critical  where you ve got to engage with developers in seconds and minutes  not raise a ticket and wait for a developer to open up their e-mail and find that.,-0.35445977561175823,NEGATIVE
So  the timeliness of getting that work done is really important. So  that is an area that we will continue to invest in. And I think we have to think about is that the right business model to do that long-term  et cetera  but I m also always trying to help to make sure we re not focusing on too many things at once.

Yes. Okay. And then -- so just kind of pushing a little bit  pushing you to a little bit on the guide. And I think Jennifer maybe let the cat out of the bag on     growth  your expectations  which I d love to hear and everybody wants more. Just for the growth in Event Intelligence  the growth in the digital ops platform and the acceleration you re seeing in enterprise and the comeback in SMB  the net expansion range you gave Howard of     to      I guess  anything can happen in any quarter on that metric. But why would that metric go backwards from where we are today  Is there something under the hood that you re looking at ,0.007080480456352234,NEUTRAL
Howard Wilson,0.00016406064969487488,NEUTRAL
Yes. So  just the mechanics  the range that we provided is     to      we ve seen some steady acceleration over the last two quarters in terms of that number. Part of the reason for why we expect it to fluctuate a bit is our expansions are often related to customers  renewals  right  So  that s often a time  so there s a seasonality element to it that can change when these things -- these occur. Sometimes we bring the renewal forward  and so there s an early renewal.,-0.015139197930693626,NEUTRAL
The other aspect of this is it s very hard to always be sure exactly which customers in a cohort are going to expand. So  whilst we ve seen a high level of predictability  particularly in the enterprise in terms of seeing roughly a third of our customers expand every quarter  it s hard to know exactly from which cohort  how many will expand. But we re feeling comfortable with our ability to forecast it and that s why we ve decided this year to give focus a view on where we think we would land between the  .   and  .    expecting that whenever we land on average  enterprise would be high.,-0.01643756590783596,MIXED
Chad Bennett,0.0006597351748496294,NEUTRAL

Correct.,0.44246221287176013,POSITIVE

Howard Wilson,0.00016406064969487488,NEUTRAL
We would expect that  obviously  enterprise being a large contributor to that number as enterprise continues to grow  and we see that momentum continue  it would contribute positively to the dollar-based net retention.,0.07575058750808239,NEUTRAL
Jennifer Tejada,0.0010443444189149886,NEUTRAL
Yes  and I ll jump in there. Just to add a comment. I mean  I am reasonably optimistic about the macro right now. I use the words right now very intentionally. I mean who knows what s going to happen in fall  And so  I just want to point out that  like we re still in a very volatile  unpredictable macro environment. And we re obviously thinking about that. My comments around getting back into the   s  like that s not a guide. That is -- I am confident this company will get back with a free handle in front of it  but I m not telling you when.,0.27215735986828804,POSITIVE
Howard Wilson,0.00016406064969487488,NEUTRAL
Yes. And I mean  I would just say  Chad  last year at this time  we were having a very different call  like the world is falling apart. And I was trying to give guidance at that point in time  we decided not to suspend guidance despite the uncertainty and we re we ve actually make sure that we ve exceeded our guidance every quarter. So my view is that I want to make sure that what I have visibility of today  and we have reasonable visibility that leads us to give the guide that we do.,0.09715148247778416,NEUTRAL
Jennifer Tejada,0.0010443444189149886,NEUTRAL
Howard also makes a really good point that if you think about PagerDuty on the whole and you think about our team and kind of how we think about our own business  we are durable. It s a very durable business. It s been a pretty predictable business. Our customer expansion      of our enterprise customers expanding every quarter have been predictable. And that s because our customers have become reliant on us  and they are consistently growing through their user base and through add-ons. And I expect that to continue. So that is one of those things that gives me a lot of confidence.,0.0391177237033844,MIXED
Chad Bennett,0.0006597351748496294,NEUTRAL
Fair point from both of you on the guide last year. You were one of the few  I will point out. Just one follow-up real quick  I assume the expectations on new logo contribution for the year in terms of mix have not changed or any kind of different expectations on new logo contribution ,0.1133105531334877,POSITIVE
Howard Wilson,0.00016406064969487488,NEUTRAL
So the way I would frame this is that  the real revenue or ARR drivers for us are mid-market and enterprise logos. And those remain for us an area of focus. Obviously  we are keen to add logos in the SMB space and very small business because that s where a lot of these companies start out. But what actually contributes to our results significantly  it s the up-market numbers. And our expectations is that. we will continue to see those grow at a healthy rate.,0.13705369783565402,NEUTRAL

Q   Kingsley Crane,8.30718781799078e-05,NEUTRAL
Hi  good to see you and thanks for fitting me in. I had a quick one on the user counts  the         users. Up     is remarkable  higher than     growth last year and growing a little bit faster than revenue. So as we think about heading towards the   million user count  should we expect user count to continue to outpace revenue  How should we think about the drivers between customer service  And you re also seeing a higher percentage of ARR due to digital ops as well  so ,0.40372977685183287,POSITIVE
Owen Wilson,-8.405707194469869e-05,NEUTRAL
Yes. Should I take it  Jen  or do you want to ,0.18203612323850393,NEUTRAL
Jennifer Tejada,0.0010443444189149886,NEUTRAL
I ll take a crack at it  and then you can correct me. So the number one  I think  what we re seeing is  the expansion of new teams across the organizations that we serve  particularly driven by digital operations management plan. I think that s really helping us.,0.18145208433270454,NEUTRAL
The second thing is  we launched stakeholders and business response last year  and so we re seeing an uptick in stakeholder adoption. And those stakeholder licenses have a lower pricing than a traditional license  so that will drive additional users on the platform.,-0.06665286049246788,NEUTRAL
The last thing would be our free product  which is going to continue to drive additional users onto the platform  which gives us a lot more trial at the top of the funnel. So those are some of the things that I think are going to drive that user growth up in ways that I think are very positive for the company long term.,0.13238367438316345,POSITIVE
Owen Wilson,-8.405707194469869e-05,NEUTRAL
Yes. And the         users are all paid users that we re referring to there. So this is representative of us becoming more ubiquitous within the organization  as we ve been used more broadly across an organization  different use cases.,0.00853351317346096,NEUTRAL
So  for example  if you re in a pure customer service type use case  you re not going to -- the kind of plan that you would need would be a different plan. Hence  we created a different SKU for it to someone who s in dev. So that accounts for some of the variation there. But I would certainly expect that it will outpace the revenue growth.,-0.2626337129622698,NEGATIVE
Kingsley Crane,0.0005372872110456228,NEUTRAL
Okay. That s helpful. And then  last one. Already on version three of the Zendesk integration  which was recently released  that shows the pace of software development today.

Jennifer Tejada,0.0010443444189149886,NEUTRAL
I mean  one thing we ve learned is really hard being a customer service agent. Like  if you think about  like  whose jobs have gotten more difficult by being remote and by being at a home  a lot of troubleshooting happens when you re sitting together in the same area and your team manager is there and your unit managers there  et cetera.,-0.4173228070139885,NEGATIVE
Customer service  I think  have been impacted by layoffs. Customers are using the public interweb to drive their feedback into an organization as opposed to chat and phone calls like they have in the past and e-mail. So I think it s tough to be a customer service agent.,-0.4704380180919543,NEGATIVE
And one of the things that we ve learned is  anything we can do to make the contact switching to make the information consumption more actionable to orchestrate a response more quickly  has a huge impact  not just on productivity  but on the health of that customer service team and ultimately  the end consumer experience.,0.23441336583346128,NEUTRAL
And so  usability  which is one of the things that we re known for  is really important in that use case. Connecting people within the platform they re in  Salesforce Service Cloud  Zendesk  etcetera  and being able to give them everything they need to know about an incident  everything they need to know about who s on it  how long it s taking  et cetera  without them having to pivot into other platforms  super important. And that s where our integration investments  I think  have really made a big difference. But I think we re very  very early here.,0.2626231396570802,POSITIVE

Thanks  Aaron. Hello  everyone. Thank you for joining our earnings call today. We are very pleased to see solid improvement continued this quarter on our financial and operational performance. Revenue for Q       was at the high end of our guidance. Both adjusted EBITDA and net income before goodwill write-down increased substantially.,0.49029851453815354,POSITIVE
     was an unprecedented year of challenges amidst COVID-   pandemic  which affected the China s education industry and our company. We took immediate action in the onset of the academic to stabilize the business with the quick deployment of our Online-Merge-Offline or OMO strategy  and gradually recover the business with various initiatives to develop a unique and strong multi-disciplinary capability-based educational platform.,0.05067854141816497,NEUTRAL
As the pandemic containment gradually return life to normalcy in China  almost all of our offline learning centers resumed normal operation in the fourth quarter. Following the reopening of our self-owned learning centers in Beijing by the end of September       our business essentially recovered during the fourth quarter with significant improvement on both operational and financial side.,0.26829215278849006,POSITIVE
During this quarter  new student enrollments increased on a yearly basis for both RISE regular courses and other courses.,0.005055407120380551,NEUTRAL
Total revenue reached the high-end of our guidance. And adjusted EBITDA was close to the level compared with the fourth quarter of     . This encouraging result  not only demonstrated the effectiveness of our strategy to navigate this new economic environment and contain the impact of COVID-   on our business  but has also positioned us well to see its new growth opportunities in the future.,0.3317196040734416,POSITIVE
I will begin my remarks from slide three. Throughout       we move forward step-by-step and mitigate the impact of COVID-   and steadily steer the recovery of our business. We are pleased to see that we re on-track to transform our business into the OMO model  which focuses on our offline learning centers  where we will continue to enhance our in-house digital infrastructure and cater to online demands.,0.29697739334369544,POSITIVE
Our integrated offline and online operations are strategically put in place to leverage our large offline student base  satisfy parents and students need. At the same time  OMO has tactical benefits to deal with the potential re-emergence of COVID-   restrictions.,0.1357089571247343,NEUTRAL
Let s move on to our financial and operational highlights for the fourth quarter on slide four. Revenues were RMB    million in the first quarter  up     from the prior quarter. Adjusted EBITDA excludes share based compensation expenses and the impairment loss on long-term investments from EBITDA was RMB   million  up     quarter-over-quarter and close to level compared with the fourth quarter of     .,0.0013900971971452236,NEUTRAL
Total number of new students for RISEs regular courses reached       in the fourth quarter  an increase of     year-over-year. As of December   st       the cumulative number of enrolled students who paid for regular courses and other courses  since January     -     exceeded         and        respectively.,0.004062124527990818,NEUTRAL
Our extensive fee pay base underpins our significant scalability and monetization potential under the OMO model. With a comprehensive digital operation system and a large customer database  we can conduct cost efficient marketing to either  expand cross selling opportunities or reactivate past customers effectively.,0.02433918957831338,NEUTRAL
For our capacity expansion as of the end of December       our self operated    learning centres  compared with    in September       our franchise partners opened another    new centres in the fourth quarter  bringing the total number of franchise -- the learning centers to     at the end of December compared with     at the end of September     .,0.016371995050576515,NEUTRAL
Now I would like to give you more color on the    quarter-over-quarter decline in the number of students in class in the fourth quarter of     . Firstly  from what we have observed during the COVID-   pandemic  offline education remains the top priority for many parents  which is also our core business under the OMO model  due to the cumulative impact from the closure of our self-owned learning centers during the first three quarters of       our new students enrollment number was lower than the normal levels.,-0.1883793082088232,NEGATIVE
Secondly  online experience was not as good as offline learning. Our retention rate saw a decline compared with       as some parents choose not to retain courses for their children during the pandemic slowed down.,-0.47145229901070707,NEGATIVE
Thirdly  with offline classes resumed  a large number of students completed their courses and graduate from RISE. Therefore  total outflow of students is larger than inflow. New students enrolled need to wait for classes to start. These factors altogether impacted the total number of student in class at the end of Q      .,-0.017497081542387605,NEUTRAL
However  this should be a short-term phenomenon as new student enrollments continued to gain strong traction with healthy growth over the last two quarters and onward  plus the retention rate is trending up in the fourth quarter  we believe the number of students in offline classrooms will recover very soon in the first half of     .,-0.021980248391628265,NEUTRAL
Now  on to slide five  as the COVID-   epidemic continues to ease in China  almost all of our learning centers resumed normal operations in the fourth quarter. Thanks to our strong offline presence and proven monetization capabilities under the OMO model  our revenues continue to improve and closed the gap vis- -vis the fourth quarter of      and adjusted EBITDA increased   .   over the previous quarter  reflecting well our effective cost control measure.,0.1462417971342802,NEUTRAL
Our OMO model provides more flexibility to students  freeing up classrooms to increase utilization and our ability to switch seamlessly between online and offline resources also makes the business resilient under the pandemic situation.,0.24124206494889222,NEUTRAL
Now please turn to slide six. We continue to see improved profitability in the fourth quarter. As I mentioned before  adjusted EBITDA trending up and the margin improved to   .   from   .   a year ago  and   .   in the previous quarter.,0.254059043712914,POSITIVE
We see three positive factors behind the encouraging result. The first is a topline improvement driven by solid growth in enrollment and the number of classes delivered as a result of the successful deployment of the OMO strategy.,0.33796985336812213,POSITIVE
The second is our continuous enhancement  our digital capabilities which contributed to the improvement of the overall operational efficiency. The third factor is our operational improvements  including various measures to increase the retention rate  classroom utilization rate  and efficient cost control.,0.17474120104452595,NEUTRAL
In the fourth quarter  cost of revenues decreased on both quarterly and yearly basis and customer acquisition costs declined significantly to RMB      from RMB       in the fourth quarter of     .,-0.08665333688259125,NEUTRAL
Online acquisition of new students has become more and more costly in China -- in China s seriously competitive education industry. However  under the OMO model  we have further reduced the customer acquisition costs by overweighting offline marketing channels and cross-selling our product offerings.,0.026454800739884377,NEUTRAL
Now  onto slide seven  we maintained solid growth momentum in new student enrollment compared with the fourth quarter of     . Our multi-channel strategy proved very effective in driving new enrollments  while controlling customer acquisition costs.,0.35088519295095466,POSITIVE
In the fourth quarter  new student enrolled for regular courses increased by     year-over-year. Chinese parents  enthusiasm for investing in their children s education remains undeterred by any means and offline courses are still the preferred choice for our target younger aged students.,0.07080399617552757,NEUTRAL

Lihong Wang,-0.003753406461328268,NEUTRAL
Okay. I can start and then Warren can add more insights. For customer acquisition costs  as you mentioned  Lauren  we see here is competition from our online channels. So  the strategy for us is to continue to use our offline channels and the wage for the leads to be generated through offline channels continue to increase. The overall percentage is already close to    . So      of the leads coming from our offline learning center promotions and offline activities.,0.04378200450446457,NEUTRAL
We think we ll continue to focus on offline this year.

However  as I mentioned  for the fourth quarter and continued in the first two months of this year  we see the retention rate going up to the normal level.

Hi. Thank you for taking my question. Sorry that I lost my connection for awhile. So if my question is already answered you may skip it. I have a few questions here. The first one is about the regulation risk impact. Can you share some of your thinking about this regulation this time in this year  Well  how and how could that impact the new learning center   new learning center opening because you have     learning center opening plan and teacher and tuition fee collection and also maybe the capital supervision impact ,0.21933715627528727,NEUTRAL

And second one is  you re now expanded your subject to mathematics and logic thinking. So could you share some more color on how you   how   what the strategy on this or the operations thinking on this like how this cost develop is internally. And how will acquire students and what the price for the subject  And you are targeting number one for   in the offline. So  can ask the near-term target maybe what the current revenue contribution from the subject retention in this year  And last one is  what s your franchise acquisition plan this year  Thank you.,0.10414110124111176,NEUTRAL
A   Lihong Wang,-0.0011533545330166817,NEUTRAL
Thank you  Sheng. Let me answer the first question first. In terms of regulation  we all know that during this month  particularly and started from Beijing that more regulation target  I would say the training or the -- what we call the  Foreign Language  Sheng as you mentioned there are a number of areas that government wanted to tighten the regulations and put more supervisions. The first is so-called the license to operate ex-curriculum. And for this one it really reinforced the regulation published in     .,0.27610185695812106,POSITIVE
So we checked our licensing status and feel majority of our schools already obtained licenses and approval. Only a very small number of schools is in the process to getting licensed. And maybe two to three in Beijing there are hard obstacles. For example the property is not -- cannot satisfy the requirement.,-0.44048657108214684,NEGATIVE
So  I would say  we don t have much issue around that area. The second area  the government wanted to put more -- maybe restrictive measures is the tuition -- prepaid tuition. However  how to really regulate this is front is still uncertain. And for RISE we already have experience in Shanghai for example that we need to put in a so-called custodian account for each school we opened. And so this is not an issue for RISE particularly with abundant cash that we have on hand.,-0.05687257368117571,MIXED
The second possibility on this front is to work with a bank or insurance firm to put in measures to make sure that if there s anything happened with the so-called providers then the parents can get the money refund. On this one  we still are waiting for the detailed implementations. Personally  I feel this is not easy to implement  so Warren will look for partners and see what is a better way to cope with the regulation.,-0.4012009003199637,NEGATIVE
The third you mentioned is  whether government encouraging the education accountant. I think for RISE we target a very young age starting at  . And majority of our students are aged    to   and the teaching content for RISE focuses on how to communicate  how to think logically and how to become the leader for the future. I think this teaching or educational philosophy is consistent with what government wanted to promote. And we are confident that we -- plus the mathematical logic thinking courses  we really focus on how to train the kids to be a creative thinker  to be a logic thinker rather than focusing on test prep. So hopefully on the regulation side  we will not be the one really targeted by the government.,0.17596520751249045,NEUTRAL
In terms of learning centers in Beijing  we already received requirement from a local district educational bureau to submit documentations and we have data on that. Some of the requirements associated with putting money in the custodian account and also ask a certain percentage of destination. So  we are all in the process to satisfy those requirements. However  I don t know when we will be allowed to open.,-0.003151997923851013,NEUTRAL
Across the nation  we don t see stricter restrictions. And as you can see that our new centers continue to open outside Beijing both direct owned and franchisee centers. So we have the full confidence that this should not be a problem on the center expansion.,0.003130502998828888,NEUTRAL
The second question regarding the mathematical logic thinking. In fact  we started to create STEAM courses in the middle of     . So this -- the cost development has been ongoing for quite some time. During the pandemic  because we have to move everything online. We made the decision to simplify the STEAM courses to focus on mathematical logic thinking. So that courses already been offered to students since June     . And we have tried out in our self-owned learning centers to recruit students and also higher new students recruit new students online directly.,0.06547677429625764,NEUTRAL
So we have experience on the teaching and we already have a number of times of renewal for that classes. The reason we think we wanted to target offline because first RISE has a very strong offline network. Second we have very good experience running offline centers both on the operational side and teaching side. The third is  we see the landscape -- we feel this is a sector already get embraced by parents. However  there is no clear leader in the offline market. And through the surveys we conducted  we feel very similar to English  a majority of the parents are very willing to consider offline courses offered in this category.,0.009219162166118622,NEUTRAL
As I mentioned we have a plan. So the two ways that we expand our network  one is we ll open a dedicated classroom in our existing self-owned centers. This year we already started three in Beijing  and we target to open dedicated classrooms in    to    self-owned learning centers this year.,0.03834071281016804,NEUTRAL
On the franchisee network side  we will start from our existing franchisees. In fact  the first franchise schools will be open in -- hopefully in April in Guangzhou. And this year the target is to sign on     franchisees partners. However  because it s offline  they need time to open stores. So for the schools  at the end of the year  hopefully  we ll see dedicated to mathematics logic franchisee learning centers to be around    to    schools.,0.025460908538661897,NEUTRAL
In terms of revenue  it is still early. So pardon me that we are not at the stage to give you the number. However  with the plan to leverage our existing student base and learning centers and franchisee partners  we feel very confident that we can roll out the mathematical logic thinking courses very quickly to be meaningful -- with meaningful scales at the end of the year.

Warren Wang,4.869862459599972e-05,NEUTRAL
Lihong  I ll take this. The guidance for the full year      basically shows a resume wide range  due to the uncertainties of COVID-   and the progress of our online  offline operations in this industry.,-0.1242079809308052,NEUTRAL
As I mentioned in the script of ER that basically we were quite optimistic about the COVID-   situations in this year. And also  we have   you can see that we have a strong results in this quarter. We ve demonstrated that we recover from all these impacts and we are quite optimistic about this coming year.,0.41616884316317737,POSITIVE
That s the   again  let me readout the guidance for the     . We expect our revenue in the full year to be in the range of RMB       million to RMB       million. And for this quarter      the Q   as you ll probably know like  there s a slight COVID-   impact in Beijing and the Shijiazhuang around the Chinese New Year  and so the revenue is around let s say  RMB     million because of the COVID-  . And   but the performance for this quarter will not represent the actual operating outcome and that s we have strong confidence than for the whole year guidance  we can make it. Thank you.,-0.09078744798898697,NEUTRAL
Lihong Wang,-0.003753406461328268,NEUTRAL
Yeah  I ll just add some color for this year. As I mentioned  we right now have very strong operational capability delivering OMO model  which means that in normal situations  our higher grade classes will have online during weekday. And then all the weekend classes are delivered offline.,0.19580413214862347,NEUTRAL
However  if there s any COVID-   situation comes up  we will switch the classes online. We can do that within a couple of hours. So in the case of Shijiazhuang and Beijing  basically the next day  every classes was put online. However  the online  as you know that has shorter time  therefore the revenue recognition will be some compromise or discount. That s why for the first quarter  we still don t know when Beijing will open  therefore will impact revenue recognition.,-0.057898055762052536,NEUTRAL
However  with the capability to switch online  offline  also the ability to offer additional courses online  including the English small classes  plus the expansion plans  both on the network and the category  we feel      will be a very exciting year. So  near-term maybe some fluctuation  but for the whole year  we have a very high confidence that we ll be able to deliver very strong results.,0.37474287231452763,POSITIVE

Hi management. Thanks for taking my questions. I have one more question. It s on the competitive landscape. So  how do management view the current competition environment. So  we noticed that certain AI classes are gaining popularity recently such as Zebra  AI cost  et cetera. So  how do management view the challenge this kind of new form player has brought  Thank you.,0.2262098331702873,NEUTRAL
Lihong Wang,-0.003753406461328268,NEUTRAL
Thank you. It s a very good question. On the competitive landscape  we definitely feel      also onwards going forward will be very interesting. First thing first  we still see very strong demand for offline learning at the same time  combined with desire to have online exposure as well.,0.4938021870511875,POSITIVE
So  on the offline side  in fact  we actually see fewer competitors. Some really cannot just survive during the pandemic and the people survived  especially like RISE offering OMO model becomes stronger. That s also why you see a very strong enrollment in fourth quarter.,-0.16881677880883217,NEUTRAL
Normally  fourth quarter is not a peak season. However  the fourth quarter enrollment for us almost caught up with the third quarter of     . So  on the offline side  we feel very confident. We definitely are the top choices for parents and students.,0.41395984368864447,POSITIVE
For online  there are more formats and players coming into the arena. I think Zebra as you mentioned  use AI to offer    minutes of classes -- class coaching and then they can offer at a very cheap price.,0.12113320175558329,NEUTRAL
The observation I have is that definitely attract a lot of young-aged kids and it s a very complementary courses to offline study. And in fact  during the survey  we can see that     of our students would have some form of online courses  either Zebra or a VIPKid.,0.3589957448421046,POSITIVE
However  at the same time  the online students normally would also have one offline courses to complement that because the courses delivered online has a limited effect. So  going forward  we think these two formats will coexist. And even for RISE  as I mentioned during the presentation  we definitely see the demand  therefore we launched the      to      premium English small classes online  using foreign teachers. This is also a supplement to what we offer offline and through OMO.,0.09940807148814201,NEUTRAL
So on the higher grade  from S  above the online foreign teacher is part of the normal courses. And for K  and S   we actually are selling our      to      premium online English small classes as additional courses to supplement them. And this year  this is part of the strategy as well. So  we think  right now  the student base  we target  we don t see impacted by the AI courses  of course  the efficacy are entirely different.,-0.013728082180023193,NEUTRAL

Thank you  David  and welcome  everyone  to our year-end      call. Let s start with a review of the key highlights of our fourth quarter. We exceeded the high end of our guidance with sales volumes of       barrels of oil equivalent per day  of which     was oil. Contributing to our production outperformance was a continuation of our highly successful workover and reactivation efforts. We also performed   CTRs in the fourth quarter  including   in the Northwest Shelf and   in the Central Basin Platform. Our ongoing CTR program converts wells from electrical submersible pumps to rod pumps  which reduces future overall operating costs and lessens costly workovers.,0.4100542382366257,POSITIVE
During the fourth quarter  we generated     million of adjusted EBITDA that contributed     million of free cash flow during the period  marking our fifth consecutive quarter of free cash flow. We utilized our free cash flow and the cash on hand to pay down     million of bank debt and ended the period with     million of liquidity  increasing our liquidity by more than     than what we had at the end of the third quarter.,0.022638680617092177,NEUTRAL
Finally  with the funds from equity rays and supported by rising oil price environment  in early December  we initiated a targeted Northwest Shelf drilling program that focuses on our highest rate of return inventory. All   of the wells drilled in our winter drilling campaign have been completed and are on production. As we noted in our release  the first well we drilled  the Badger     B  XH  is currently producing over     barrels of oil a day and is still cleaning up. We are pleased to see initial production results from these   wells have exceeded our expectations.,0.4119241959124338,POSITIVE
Now let s take a look at the full year     . Our average sales were       barrels of oil equivalent per day  of which     was oil. We performed    CTRs  including    in the Northwest Shelf and    in the Central Basin Platform. Our continuing targeted CTR workover and reactivation programs  combined with our ongoing cost optimization initiatives  contributed to a lifting cost of    .   per BOE  an    decrease year-over-year. We generated     million of adjusted EBITDA that contributed to     million of free cash flow  which we used to help pay down     million of bank debt during     .,0.03212161100236699,NEUTRAL
Turning to our year-end      reserves and based on SEC reserve prices -- yes  SEC average prices of    .   per BOE or barrels of oil and   .   per MMBtu of natural gas  we reported year-end      proved reserves of   .  million barrels of oil equivalent  which was down modestly from our   .  million barrels of oil equivalent we had at the year-end     .

Our SEC proved reserves were comprised of     crude oil and     natural gas  with   .   of total proved reserves classified as proved developed  and the remaining   .   as proved undeveloped.

For detailed discussions of our various income statement line items  please refer to our earnings release and   -K that was filed yesterday. I m happy to answer any questions on them during our Q A. As Paul discussed  we were pleased to generate free cash flow once again during the fourth quarter of       our fifth consecutive quarterly period. During       we paid down     million on our credit facility  and we will continue to use much of our free cash flow for that purpose. Paul will discuss in more detail in his closing comments  but with the recently initiated targeted drilling program  we are in a stronger position to pay down debt even faster given the high rates of return afforded by our deep inventory of drilling prospects. As we previously announced  in December  we completed our fall bank redetermination  and our borrowing base was set at      million. As of December     we had      million drawn on our credit facility  which resulted in liquidity of    .  million  including     million available on the revolver and   .  million of cash and cash equivalents.,0.1551594728953205,NEUTRAL
Finally  we are affirming the full year      outlook we provided on February     including year-over-year average sales growth between    and     which equates to       to       BOE per day with approximately     to     oil. For full year       we anticipate an average -- sorry  yes        we anticipate an average lifting cost of   .   to    .   per BOE  which reflects a decrease compared to full year      lifting cost of    .   per BOE.,-0.008129006251692772,NEUTRAL
Turning to our      capital investment program  we plan to drill   to   wells and complete   to    wells during the full year     . We are targeting total capital spending of     million to     million  with all expenditures to be funded by cash on hand and cash from operations. In addition to company-directed drilling and completion activities  our capital spending outlook includes targeted well reactivations  workovers  infrastructure upgrades and continuing our successful CTR program in the Northwest Shelf and Central Basin Platform areas. Also included is anticipated spending for leasing  contractual drilling obligations and non-operated drilling  completion and capital workovers.,0.0184372922158218,NEUTRAL
Our      capital program has been designed to sustain or minimally grow our production and reserve levels and have returns sufficient to generate free cash flow to further reduce debt.

Thank you  Randy. On our third quarter earnings call  I discussed in detail Ring s competitive strengths as well as the challenges we face and how we were addressing them. A lot has changed over the past   months since we last spoke  mostly for the better. However  I want to talk a little about the severe winter storm that affected most of the energy industry here in Texas and  more specifically  how it affected our production.,0.3435497526079416,POSITIVE
We incurred a considerable hit on our production in February  down more than     for the majority of the storm. We had an unusual amount of downtime that took us   weeks or more to restore. Our first quarter production will be less than what we were originally predicting as a result of this downtime. However  we have restored our production  and with the performance of our new wells and the continued improvements we are seeing in our other initiatives  we will still generate free cash flow for a sixth straight quarter  we will still pay down debt  and we are not going to change our full year guidance.,0.022756189107894897,MIXED
The next thing I want to discuss is our new strategic vision. We are committed to key principles that we are squarely focused on  ensuring health  safety and environmental excellence and a strong commitment to our employees and the communities in which we work and operate  continuing to generate free cash flow to improve and build a sustainable financial foundation  pursuing rigorous capital discipline focused on our highest-returning opportunities  improving margins and driving value by continuously targeting additional operating cost reductions and capital efficiencies  and strengthening our balance sheet by steadily paying down debt  divesting of noncore assets and becoming a peer leader in debt-to-EBITDA metrics. These key principles will continue to guide us  and we are committed to them by pursuing the following   strategic objectives  first  we will attract and retain the best people  knowing that our future success can only be achieved through our employees. Second  we will pursue operational excellence with a sense of urgency. This objective is a foundation that will define our culture and future success.,0.0951846654061228,NEUTRAL
So what does that mean exactly  We will execute our operations in a safe and environmentally responsible manner  apply advanced technologies and continuously seek ways to reduce our operating cash cost on a per-barrel basis. We plan to deliver low-cost  consistent and efficient execution of our drilling campaigns  our work programs and other operations  all with a high sense of urgency.,0.06623046571621671,NEUTRAL
An example of this is our highly successful CTR program  which reduces operating expenses and lessens costly workovers. The impact from this program can be seen in the decrease in our lifting cost per BOE from    .   in      to    .   in     . Our confidence in this aspect of our culture is reflected in our forecast of continuing to lower cost this year from anywhere from   .   to    .   per BOE.,0.19057853508275002,NEUTRAL
And yet another example is we relocated our headquarters to the Woodlands and downsized the Midland office  closed our Andrews field office  are in the process of closing the Tulsa office  reducing leasing expenses and resulting in meaningful annual cost savings. But the biggest impact of this change is not the cost savings  it is the consolidation of the executive and management teams  allowing for improved communication  strategizing  execution and continuing to build our culture.,0.0037268493324518204,NEUTRAL
Moving on to the third strategic objective is to prioritize our work programs and invest in only the highest risk-adjusted rate of return projects in our inventory. This will allow us to profitably grow our production and reserve levels and generate the excess free cash flow we need to pay down debt. We have already discussed our CTR program and our Northwest Shelf drilling program  but both of these demonstrate our commitment to generate as much free cash flow as we can from every dollar we spend. As you know  we drilled   Northwest Shelf San Andres horizontal oil wells in December and January  including    . -mile horizontal wells and    -mile horizontal well. All wells are now completed and producing at various stages of cleanup. Early production results have been at or above expectations  and we look forward to completing the full program over the next few months.,0.03836614734609611,NEUTRAL
Moving on to the fourth strategic objective  which is the -- which is to focus on generating free cash flow and strengthening our balance sheet by reducing debt. We intend to do this through the use of excess cash from operations and potentially through the proceeds from the sale of noncore assets. Last month  we announced our plan to launch a sales process to divest of our Delaware Basin assets during the second quarter of this year  we are still committed to that plan. Remaining focused and disciplined in this regard will lead to meaningful returns for our shareholders and also provides additional financial flexibility to manage commodity price cycles in the future.,0.06691189549746923,NEUTRAL
And moving on to our fifth and final strategic objective is to pursue strategic acquisitions that maintain or reduce our breakeven cost. We will focus on accretive acquisitions  mergers and dispositions that not only improve our breakeven cost but improve our margins  lower our operating costs and are accretive on a cash flow basis. Our financial strategies associated with these efforts will focus on delivering competitive risk- and debt-adjusted per share returns for our shareholders.,0.011177426320500672,NEUTRAL
I want to end my prepared comments by  once again  thanking the entire team of Ring employees for their continued hard work and dedication. The past year has clearly been the most challenging in modern times on a global scale  and especially for the oil and gas industry. While I have only been in the company for a little over   months  I have quickly come to appreciate the collective determination and dedication of Ring s employees at all levels of the organization. As important  I appreciate the way they have so quickly embraced our new strategic vision  which is evident in our operational and financial results as a direct result of their actions.

And so yes  we believe that the prices are better this year. We have also made investments out there to stabilize production  and also we ve done a better job of looking at and actually separating out our facilities that are associated with our production and in those portions of our facilities that could be used for commercial saltwater disposal.

Okay. Great. I appreciate that. And digging into the M A a little bit without asking for any secret sauce  so wondered if you could give us some broad gating items with regard to M A  both on the sort of assets that you desire and any financing variables.,0.4727877591503784,POSITIVE
Paul McKinney,0.0001312423264607787,NEUTRAL
Yes. Very good. I ll address the financing first because that s the obvious thing. Yes  we ve got a challenging balance sheet  okay  And so with the debt load that we have  we would like to use equity where we can. We would like to emerge from any kind of a transaction with -- making further progress. We re strengthen our balance sheet  and we think that we can do that. We believe now that prices have come back up to a more reasonable level  there are more sellers out there  if you want to call them that. There are more sellers willing to sell at these prices  whereas at the -- if you look back at -- in November  December of last year when prices were still pretty low  really  nobody wanted to sell their assets at     oil.,0.21989109739661217,POSITIVE
Now getting back to the portion of your question associated with what type of assets  well  we really like the area that we re in. We really like the economics of the projects that we have in our own inventory. And so yes  ideally  we would like to spread our very effective operating team over more wells and more barrels of production in the areas that we operate. So the synergies is an obvious thing. And so -- however  I m not going to tell you that we would only buy assets in and around where we currently operate. But I will say that if we do venture outside of the Central Basin platform  the Southern Shelf  it ll be because the attributes of the acquisition bring with them similar attributes of shallow declines  high margins  undeveloped opportunity  have low breakeven costs and short payouts and that type of thing. And probably primarily oil as well.,0.045782580971717834,NEUTRAL

Well  we re being forced to kind of reevaluate things on a daily basis with the product prices being what they are at higher levels today than anybody was predicting just a couple of months ago. We were originally thinking that we were going to pick up a drilling rig to start our next campaign sometime in the summer.

Well  good morning from Seattle  Washington. My name is Kevin Johnson  and it is my pleasure to welcome you to Starbucks    th Annual Meeting of Shareholders. I m particularly energized by the many Starbucks partners and store managers who are joining us today.

Hello  everyone. My name is Camille Hymes  a proud  -year partner  and I m walking the cobblestones in Seattle s historic Pike Place Market  the birth place of Starbucks and still home to our first store. I ve been searching for just the right word to describe the journey of Starbucks so far from its start in       selling whole bean coffee  to  well  today     years later. The word that keeps coming to mind is epic. And I m not just saying that because I m your narrator.,0.4814456650055945,POSITIVE
The story of Starbucks is everything  twists and turns  setbacks and breakthroughs  values and pinnacles. Like all good tales  there are a few different roads we can take to get to the heart of this one. Today  we ll walk a cobblestone one in Milan  Italy. It s on this road where we ll meet a young man from Seattle on a trip that will forever change the way the world experiences coffee. The year      .,0.43219888120074756,POSITIVE
That young man s name  Howard Schultz. He was on his first visit to Italy  and as he strolled through the streets and the plazas of Milan  he was overwhelmed by the architecture  fashion  art  music  the magic of the place and especially its espresso bars. Back home in Seattle  Howard was working as the Marketing Director of a small business called Starbucks. At the time  Starbucks sold bags of whole bean arabica coffee as well as tea and spices at   stores around the city. Now while wandering Italy  Howard noticed these casual  welcoming coffee houses everywhere.,0.09537130082026124,NEUTRAL
All who entered these caf s were greeted with the same warmth and enthusiasm  whether it was their first visit ever or their third that day. The people holding cups of espresso and cappuccino were family and friends  coworkers.

This scene  this experience had a profound effect on Howard. He returned to Seattle with an idea.,0.4984605093341088,POSITIVE
Now there s no such thing as spoilers when it comes to history. So even though we all know a little something about Howard s big idea  I m going to keep going because the next part of the story is especially good. Come see. Howard was exhilarated by his idea to bring Italy s caf  and espresso culture to America  but at the time  some at Starbucks fell it would be a distraction from their business model of selling whole bean coffee. You have to remember  in       most people grew pots of coffee at home using ground coffee from the grocery store  drank their coffee at diners or restaurants.,0.05545967072248459,MIXED
They worried Americans wouldn t embrace Italian-style coffee houses. But Howard  he was determined. Eventually  he convinced Starbucks to let him open a test caf  inside a single downtown Seattle store. They gave him a little bit of space      square feet to be exact  and on a rainy morning in April       Starbucks served its first Caff  Latte.,0.09185071289539337,NEUTRAL

At the time  a handful of Starbucks whole bean coffee stores in Seattle were serving about     customers a day. The store with Howard s new coffee bar was soon serving as many as      but there was a lot more to Howard s idea than serving coffee. He believed coffee could serve to build community  empower the human connection  the kind of connections that make hard days easier and celebrations sweeter  the kind of connections that help us navigate sorrow and help bring us closer to opportunity  strength and joy. This belief in the power of coffee to bring us closer was brewed in the first cup Starbucks ever served  and it s been poured into every cup since. Take a look.,0.38568036910146475,POSITIVE
It was here at Seattle s historic Pike Place Market that   friends opened a little specialty coffee store in     . They sold coffee from places like Colombia  Indonesia  Uganda  coffee they roasted themselves and hand scooped into brown paper bags. To name the place  they looked out the front door to the waterfront for inspiration. They chose to name Starbucks  evoking a character from the classic novel  Moby Dick.

Howard Schultz deserves all the credit for his vision  his passion and his perseverance that created one of the world s most admired brands. Founders of enduring companies like Starbucks create something very special that they know intuitively will connect deeply  personally and emotionally many people. That is perhaps why  when Howard approached me several years ago  I was a bit apprehensive. Founder transitions are significant  perhaps the most significant transition a company ever goes through. Succeeding the charismatic founder of an iconic brand that reaches hundreds of millions of people around the world  well  that can be very intimidating.,0.4855230471584946,POSITIVE
And so I asked myself   What can I bring to the table  How can I help advance the mission  Is my authentic self good enough   And because of my respect for Howard and my love of Starbucks  I accepted the challenge  embraced the opportunity and grounded myself in one simple concept. My responsibility in leading a transition from founder led to founder inspired was to have the wisdom to know what to honor and preserve from the past while  at the same time  having the courage to boldly reimagine our future  honor the past and reimagine the future  wisdom and courage. I knew that we must stay true to the foundation of this great company  to our purpose grounded in humanity and to our culture of warmth and belonging. At the same time  I knew that we must look boldly to the future  adapting the third place for the world and society to come. If we don t honor and stay true to our mission and culture  we will lose our way.,0.4072956368327141,POSITIVE
But in a rapidly changing world  if we don t boldly reimagine our future  the world will pass us by. Four years ago  we gracefully led one of the most significant business transitions any company will ever go through  from a founder-led to a founder-inspired company.

In many ways  this was a transition from Howard to all of us.

I am privileged to work with so many great partners at Starbucks. So what have we done in the past   years  Well  as a team  we have transformed the way we innovate  building an ethos that allows us to bring great ideas to reality within     days. When we fail  we do so quickly  and we celebrate what we have learned from that thing. And because we constantly learn and adapt  we are agile and can respond rapidly to changes in our environment and to the needs of our customers. We have focused on the U.S. and China as our   lead markets  and that has enabled all other markets to more swiftly follow. We built an alliance with Nestl  to expand the global reach of Starbucks into the homes of millions with single-serve and at-home coffee. As a team  we navigated a global pandemic  and we did that by  first  prioritizing the safety of our partners  our customers and our communities  second  supporting local government and health officials as they work to mitigate and contain the virus  and third  showing up  showing up in a responsible and positive way in each and every community we serve.

I d like to say that I came to Starbucks for the Espresso  and it s true  I did. But I stayed because of the people  the partners. The partners at Starbucks are truly like no other.

Mr. McRitchie  are you on the line ,0.0016804534243419766,NEUTRAL
James McRitchie,0.00030462152790278196,NEUTRAL
Yes. Thank you. We ve been listening and seeing how important partners are to Starbucks. Proposal number   aims at increasing diversity by adding a worker to the pool of candidates to be considered for a position on the Board. The idea is to increase the voice of partners.,0.42411556391743943,POSITIVE
Instead of considering a partner for a possible seat at the table  the Board responded with   Our partners have numerous ways to be heard and to exert influence outside of board representation. Partners can access an ethics help line  accompany an organization meeting  partner-led groups and anonymous surveys.  The Board says giving non-management employees a dedicated position on the Board or applying a different set of qualifications would adversely impact the role of the Board.,0.03992990264669061,NEUTRAL
But the proposal does not ask for a dedicated position for partners. It does not ask for a different set of qualifications in selecting Board members. It only seeks to have partners considered in the initial pool. Surely  at least one of our         partners is worth considering for a seat at the table. If you re a partner in a firm or a marriage  you re on the same team  right  But our Board refused to consider any significant step to increase the voice of partner.,-0.16672558430582285,NEUTRAL
The Board could have appointed a formal workforce advisory panel or designated a director to be a liaison with our partner. They could have set up a substantive Employee Stock Ownership Plan  an ESOP with voting rights held by partners or their elected trustees  a worker on the Board  a workforce advisory panel or a designated director to institutionalize ongoing dialogue  an ESOP with trustees elected by partners that have a real influence on Board composition.,0.00023073656484484673,NEUTRAL
Any of these changes would engage and empower our partners  leading to a better place to work and a more profitable company. Instead  our Board refused to negotiate. This is an advisory proposal that is much more flexible than federal legislation being considered.,-0.05174337700009346,NEUTRAL
I m interested in hearing from other shareholders and especially from partners  e-mail me at jm corpgov.net  that s J-M C-O-R-P-G-O-V.net  and please vote for proposal   . Let the Board know giving partners a more formal voice is important to you. Thank you very much.,0.27878762895124964,POSITIVE

Thank you  Mr. McRitchie. For the reasons outlined in our proxy statement  the Board has recommended a vote against this shareholder proposal.,0.335845360532403,POSITIVE
From its beginning  Starbucks has set out to be a different kind of company  one where performance is measured through the lens of humanity. And the role of our partners is central to our decisions.,0.04653165634954348,NEUTRAL
Human connection is at the center of our vision  our business strategies and our investments and we are obsessive about obtaining the partner perspective that is the focus of this shareholder proposal through multiple channels  which include continuously engaging in discussions with our partners to learn how to improve their experiences. We take information communicated to us by our partners seriously  and we regularly provide responses and updates on issues that our partners raise. We value engagement with our partners  and we remain intentional in cultivating a culture of inclusion and diversity with a focus on partner retention and development.,0.03856720635667443,NEUTRAL
During      alone  we held hundreds of partner engagement events  such as open forums  focus groups  town halls and partner connect conversations. The views and experiences of our partners help to guide management s decision-making and the Board s oversight of those decisions. In this way  and as further described in our proxy statement  the Board and its Nominating and Governance Committee should retain the flexibility to determine the director nominees who are best suited to serve all Starbucks stakeholders.,0.03132164693670347,NEUTRAL
Given our frequent and varied partner communication  opportunities for partner feedback and our robust director nominating process  together with our current Board diversity and governance practices  our Board of Directors believe that taking the steps contemplated by this proposal to alter the director nomination process and to mandate that a specific category of nominee be considered by the Board and to risk distilling all partner voices into one  is simply not in the best interests of our partners or our shareholders or our business.,0.015876955585554242,NEUTRAL
That concludes the matters to be voted on as outlined in the Notice of Annual Meeting. In accordance with our bylaws  I hereby declare the polls for voting at our      annual meeting closed.,0.0029996302619110793,NEUTRAL

Yes. Thank you for that question. Starbucks has a long-standing commitment to diversity on its Board of Directors.

Kevin Johnson,0.00027758421492762864,NEUTRAL
Yes. Thanks for the question. I ll take that one. First of all  we do not have a political action committee  and therefore  we do not make political contributions. We certainly  with our partners  we encourage them to get involved in their civic responsibility as citizens to vote.,0.22304569371044636,NEUTRAL

Thank you  Kevin. In November of       Starbucks shared one of the largest-ever wage investments of at least a     increase for every single partner  including our shift supervisors. With these recent investments  more than     of our partners today already are at or over     an hour  and we remain committed to what we have already previously communicated  which is that we will ensure that every single partner in U.S. business will be at the minimum of     an hour over the next few years.,0.2958532215561718,POSITIVE
We have always approached our compensation comprehensively with a holistic partner rewards and benefits philosophy. So in addition to our base pay or hourly wage  we also offer a very diverse and meaningful co-benefit package that includes health care  mental health support  granting share options to every single partner because we always share our success with one another. And we even offer a free online college university for those partners that might want to take advantage of higher education.,0.22720140063029248,NEUTRAL
Our holistic partners rewards benefits philosophy is designed to reward every single partner for their contributions  contributing to a great work environment that promotes a shared responsibility for individual and company success.

So for example  we re applying right now how to engage customers digitally in new and convenient ways to drive traffic.

We closed     of our stores at the peak of the pandemic last year. We needed to take care of our partners and their families by providing them with jobs and financial security.

We also provided free counseling and emotional support services for partners and their family members.,0.24332911148667336,NEUTRAL

Good afternoon  everyone  and thank you for joining Salarius Pharmaceuticals      fourth quarter and full-year financial and corporate results call. Earlier this afternoon  Salarius Pharmaceuticals issued a press release detailing its financial results for the   months and the full-year ended December           which we encourage listeners to read.,0.4560537063080119,POSITIVE
The press release can be found in the News section of Solaris arma.com. Salarius also filed a   -K this afternoon  which is available on Salariuspharma.com and sec.gov. Before beginning today s call  I would like to make the following statement. Today  we ll be making certain forward-looking statements about future expectations  plans  events and circumstances including statements about our strategy  future operations and the development of our lead investigational drug candidate  seclidemstat  and our expectations regarding our capital allocation and cash resources. These statements are based on our current expectations  and you should not place undue reliance on these statements.

Thank you  Jason  and thank you to everyone joining our conference call today  including all of you who are joining for the first time. Today s call highlights an exciting time in the growth of Salarius. In just the past few weeks  we have achieved important clinical milestones in the development of our lead drug candidate  seclidemstat  and we have achieved significant milestones in financing Salarius.,0.48215590394102037,POSITIVE
We have completed the dose escalation portion of the ewing sarcoma clinical trial and seclidemstat is now being investigated at the recommended Phase II dose in three distinct patient populations made up of viewing sarcoma and Ewing-related sarcomas  which  in the case of viewing-related sarcomas  include two patient populations made up of myxoid liposarcoma and other FET-translocated sarcomas. Each of these three patient groups  Ewing sarcoma  myxoid liposarcoma and FET-translocated sarcomas potentially represents a separate regulatory path to approval and the related commercial opportunity.,0.0037955504667479545,NEUTRAL
These recent clinical milestones and the expansion of the viewing clinical trial to include Ewing s related sarcomas  further underpins and supports the first prong of our development strategy  speed to market. Salarius is now investigating three patient populations  each of which is supported by future clinical results  we believe has the potential for accelerated regulatory approval and supports our strategy of speed to market.,0.057138008167385124,NEUTRAL
In parallel  I m very pleased to report that as a result of a series of financial transactions  Salarius now has the capital resources of approximately     million in available cash to fund our current clinical trials  while providing the ability to develop seclidemstat in larger market indications  including solid tumors and hematologic cancers. These larger market indications represent the second prong of our development strategy  expand the market.,0.4026407017663587,POSITIVE
In addition to these clinical and financial achievements  we have also amended the Ewing clinical trial to expand the addressable Ewing sarcoma patient population and improve patient access to seclidemstat earlier in the patient s treatment paradigm.,0.06782967111212201,NEUTRAL
By combining seclidemstat with the common second or third-line chemotherapy treatment  topotecan and cyclophosphamide  we hope to open the door to seclidemstat s potential use much earlier in a Ewing patient s treatment continuum as a second or third-line therapy  while improving their patient outcomes.,0.008003961585927755,NEUTRAL
Let me make sure I clearly communicated the importance of these developments. We believe we have integrated seclidemstat into the Ewing sarcoma standard of care  and seclidemstat can now be easily administered as a second or third-line therapy in our ongoing clinical trial.,0.09597136123920791,NEUTRAL
In addition to increasing the number of patients who can receive seclidemstat treatment  we believe that this also makes it easier for physicians to utilize seclidemstat early in the Ewing sarcoma continuum of care  while potentially improving patient outcomes.,0.33986944900243543,POSITIVE
Finally  in a small subset of Ewing-related sarcoma patients with relapsed or refractory disease  that enrolled in the advanced solid tumor trial  all patients in the subset showed indications of seclidemstat drug activity as evidenced by a medium time to progression that was greater or longer than a benchmark commonly used for single-agent activity in this advanced relapsed soft tissue sarcoma setting. It is important to note that these indications of drug activity occurred at doses below the recommended Phase II dose that we are currently using in our ongoing Ewing and Ewing-related sarcoma trials.,0.0025240372051484883,NEUTRAL
Again  to be clear  in a small subset of patients with relapsed or refractory Ewing-related sarcoma  we observed a median increase in the patient s time to progression when compared to a benchmark commonly used for single-agent activity in the advanced relapsed soft tissue sarcoma setting.,0.006846665637567639,NEUTRAL
We believe this is exciting preliminary data of seclidemstat activity in Ewing-related sarcomas. I cannot understate our view regarding the importance of these developments to the ongoing growth of seclidemstat and Salarius  nor can I understate how well we believe this positions Salarius for the future. Mark and I look forward to speaking in detail about each of these accomplishments later in the call.,0.3352792840451002,POSITIVE
However  before that  I would like to take a moment and provide my thoughts on the past    months. If you had asked me a year ago  if Salarius would be in the position of strength that we are now in  I would have responded with a resounding  absolutely. Why would I have said that  Because we had a well-defined strategy  and we executed on a plan that I fully expected will yield positive results.,0.013038711622357368,MIXED
Of course  this plan did not factor in the COVID-   pandemic. In just a matter of days last March  the world was impacted by a once-in-a-generation situation. Salarius was not immune. But in spite of the many uncertainties  we were able to quickly make adjustments that enabled us to persevere in certain ways  become stronger as a company.,-0.12870432995259762,NEUTRAL
This type of fortitude was especially evident in those who led and participated in our clinical trials  including our clinical development team  the investigators and staff at our cancer centers that are implementing our clinical trials and most importantly  the trial participants and their families who selflessly volunteered their time and energy despite these many challenges.,0.11196500808000565,NEUTRAL
For the patients with advanced cancers participating in our clinical trials  everyday activity suddenly became an even greater ordeal. Yet these patients were willing to participate in our trials  so that we could continue developing seclidemstat to all the past and current participants in our trial  we thank you.,0.24548120645340532,POSITIVE
Later in today s discussion  I ll talk more about the positive impact of our recent clinical and financial milestone achievements and our plans to continuing developing seclidemstat for larger market indications  including solid tumors and hematological cancers.,0.041763994202483445,NEUTRAL
But now I would like to hand the call over to our Chief Financial Officer  Mark Rosenblum  who will speak to our fourth quarter and full-year      financial results. Mark  please go ahead.,0.04092731326818466,NEUTRAL
Mark Rosenblum,0.0039130897202994674,NEUTRAL
Thank you  David. For the three-month period ended December           Salarius reported a net loss of   .  million  or   .   per basic and diluted share compared to a net loss of   .  million and   .   per share in the fourth quarter of     .,-0.29243416525423527,NEGATIVE
For the full-year  Salarius reported a net loss of   .  million and   .   per basic and diluted share versus a loss of   .  million  or   .   per basic and diluted share for the prior year. The loss from operations before other income for the three months ended December          decreased by   .  million compared to the loss from operations of overall   .  million for the same time spend last year  which was primarily due to an increase of   .  million in grant revenue and lower general and administrative costs  more than offsetting higher research and development expenditures.,-0.2729286589892581,NEGATIVE
Increased research and development costs resulted from increased drug manufacturing costs. The decrease in general and administrative costs resulted from the absence of expenses related to Salarius  onetime transformation into a public company during       which did not reoccur in the current period. This offsets higher personnel costs in the current period. Our December    balance sheet states the company had    .  million in cash and cash equivalents. The balance sheet was strengthened in early      as the company raised over     million from both the sale of our common stock and underwritten public offering and warrants exercises.,-0.18123037926852703,NEUTRAL
We also received   .  million in non-dilutive secret financing during Q      . Salarius has an additional   .  million under the secret Grant  and we expect to receive a portion of that amount in     . The results of these funding activities is that Salarius has currently available cash of approximately     million  our strongest financial position to date.,0.010040750086773187,NEUTRAL
We believe Salarius has the financial resources available to advance our ongoing clinical trials through completion and beyond.,0.08268265252991114,NEUTRAL
With that  I d like to return the call to David.,-0.17196824122220278,NEUTRAL
David Arthur,0.00041129621968138963,NEUTRAL
Thank you  Mark. As we have discussed  our goal as a company is to maximize the potential of seclidemstat  and by doing so  bring hope to patients and their families facing limited treatment options  while creating and building shareholder value. To that end  I would like to state that by midyear      this year  we hope to have active clinical trials across   separate patient populations  evaluating seclidemstat as single-agent therapy and in up to   different combination therapies.,0.3202322274883045,POSITIVE
As discussed earlier  completing the dose escalation stage of our Ewing sarcoma clinical trial is a major achievement. The primary purpose of the study was to determine the safety and tolerability of seclidemstat with secondary endpoints to assess the maximum tolerated dose  determine the recommended Phase II dose and measure antitumor activity  pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. I am pleased to report that the dose escalation stage succeeded. Data demonstrated that seclidemstat has a manageable safety profile. The recommended Phase II dose for the expansion stage has been established.,0.3661865203175694,POSITIVE
And importantly  pharmacokinetic data indicated that treatment at the recommended Phase II dose achieved human plasma concentrations above levels where seclidemstat demonstrated activity in preclinical or animal studies. We believe the data from this dose escalation trial is compelling. And for this reason  Salarius has submitted the full findings  including details on safety  dosing and initial efficacy signals for presentation at an upcoming oncology conference.,0.11499856458976865,NEUTRAL
Once the conference embargo lifts  we will be able to provide more detailed information. Again  please allow me to reiterate because it is important to state clearly. The dose escalation stage of the trial achieved all key endpoints. It demonstrated seclidemstat safety profile established a recommended Phase II dose  and we believe it provided early evidence of drug activity.,0.10634918051073328,NEUTRAL
Although our dose escalation trial is primarily focused on establishing seclidemstat s safety  we believe  as we ve stated  we observed preliminary evidence supporting seclidemstat s potential to treat advanced-stage cancer patients. Notably  these observations occurred in patients primarily treated at doses below the recommended Phase II dose in patients that were heavily pretreated with multiple prior treatment failures  and in patients who had relapsed or refractory disease upon enrollment.,0.004213017120491713,NEUTRAL
This preliminary evidence of drug activity was observed in a refractory Ewing sarcoma patient who is treated with single-agent seclidemstat for     -day cycles and demonstrated more than a     tumor reduction in prospectively defined some of target lesions. However  despite this significant tumor reduction  a new non-target lesion appeared at the end of cycle    resulting in a classification of progressive disease as defined by response evaluation criteria in solid tumors  version  .  or RECIST  . .,-0.0022373689571395516,NEUTRAL
Having said that  Salarius believes this data demonstrates preliminary single agent drug activity in a patient with refractory Ewing sarcoma  meaning disease  which had failed prior medical treatments responded to seclidemstat as single-agent therapy. This is especially encouraging  given the challenge in treating refractory disease and the fact that the patient received no other cancer treatment while taking seclude stat. Given the preliminary evidence of drug activity observed  Salarius believes there is a meaningful opportunity to introduce seclidemstat earlier in the Ewing sarcoma continuum of care  which we believe will benefit patients and increase the addressable Ewing sarcoma patient population.,0.046400472754612565,NEUTRAL
Internal preclinical research suggests that Ewing sarcoma cell lines  seclidemstat has an additive effect  an additive effect when combined with the chemotherapy agents  topotecan and cyclophosphamide. This suggests the seclidemstat can be added to topotecan and cyclophosphamide and potentially improve upon current patient outcomes.,0.0036672238929895684,NEUTRAL
Additionally  because topotecan and cyclophosphamide de are commonly used as second or third-line treatment. Salarius can potentially increase the addressable patient population for seclidemstat by supporting doctors and patients use of seclidemstat earlier in the treatment paradigm.,0.004872553865425289,NEUTRAL
Based on these conditions  Salarius considerations  Salarius amended the dose expansion trial protocol so that Ewing sarcoma patients who have failed   or   prior lines of therapy may be treated with seclidemstat in combination with topotecan and cyclophosphamide as second or third-line therapy. This is an exciting development and one that aligns perfectly with our goal to increase our use of seclidemstat by exploring its potential as a treatment for a broader patient population.,0.22245017457316862,NEUTRAL
In addition to the Ewing sarcoma news  we believe we have seen encouraging clinical data from a small subset of viewing related sarcoma patients enrolled in the Salarius advanced solid tumor trial.,0.02160324336728081,NEUTRAL
All patients in this subgroup had relapsed or refractory disease when enrolled in the trial  and all patients in this subset demonstrated signs of drug activity despite being treated with seclidemstat at doses below the recommended Phase II dose. Patients in this subgroup exhibited a median time to progression longer than a commonly-used benchmark for assessing single-agent activity in this advanced relapsed soft tissue sarcoma setting. This is exactly -- and I want to repeat  this is exactly the type of data we were hoping to see to support seclidemstat s potential to treat these difficult viewing Ewing-related sarcomas and move forward with our strategy to expand in new patient populations  establish new potential paths to regulatory approval and pursue the related commercial opportunities.,0.05345936119556427,NEUTRAL
Salarius has now initiated the dose expansion stage of the Ewing and Ewing-related sarcoma trial  which was expanded to include up to    patients with relapsed or refractory Ewing sarcoma as well as up to    patients with sarcomas that share a similar biology to Ewing sarcoma. I ve referred to these as Ewing-related sarcomas or FET translocated sarcomas. These Ewing-related sarcoma patients or patients with myxoid liposarcoma and other FET translocated sarcomas will continue to be treated with single-agent seclidemstaat and represent completely new addressable patient populations  each with the potential path regulatory approval and a potential commercial opportunity.,0.01135392757714726,NEUTRAL
The dose expansion portion of the Ewing and Ewing-related trial will continue to evaluate safety and antitumor activity in all participants with preliminary data readouts expected towards the end of      and     .,0.07044035091530532,NEUTRAL
Salarius has also submitted findings from the advanced solid tumor trial  including details on safety  dosing and initial safety signals for presentation at an upcoming medical conference. Once the conference embargo lifts  we will be able to provide even more information.,0.06848048177198507,NEUTRAL
In summary  we believe the clinical data collected thus far from the Ewing sarcoma trial and the ongoing advanced solid tumor trial has demonstrated that seclidemstat has a manageable safety profile  can be administered at doses that are clinically relevant  and we believe has provided evidence of drug activity in patient populations with advanced disease.,0.013033544179052114,NEUTRAL
We believe that the clinical progress discussed today paints a promising picture of seclidemstat s potential as both a single agent and combination therapy for patients with hard-to-treat cancers in need of better treatment options.,0.12744055595248938,NEUTRAL
Salarius and our clinical investigators are excited about the potential of seclidemstat to treat Ewing sarcoma patients earlier and the potential to treat these additional Ewing sarcoma patient -- Ewing-related sarcoma patients.,0.09787162207067013,NEUTRAL
In addition -- and additionally  we believe there is a substantial unexplored potential ahead for seclidemstat  and we anticipate even more opportunities in      to justify the use of seclidemstat in other underserved cancers. In that regard  Salarius has completed much of the necessary work to begin clinical trials in other cancer indications that align with seclidemstat s mechanism of action  and we look forward to announcing these trials in the near future.,0.19240013207308948,NEUTRAL
Areas of interest we have previously discussed include hematologic cancers and the use of seclidemstat in combination with immuno-oncology therapies  specifically checkpoint inhibitors. Checkpoint inhibitors are a class of immunotherapy treatment designed to unleash a human immune system attack on cancer cells. However  these drugs do not work in all cancer patients or in all cancer types.,-0.0016250059707090259,NEUTRAL
In addition  patients do not show an initial -- in addition  patients that do show an initial response can become resistant to the checkpoint inhibitor treatment and experience a return of the disease  commonly known as disease relapse. Interestingly  data from preclinical studies conducted by the Translational Genomics Research Institute in Phoenix  Arizona  and published in the peer review journal plus   last year demonstrated the potential of using seclidemstat in combination with checkpoint inhibitors to overcome cancer s ability to hide from the immune system and thereby unleash the immune system to attack the cancer.,0.0036703816149383783,NEUTRAL
In simple terms  seclidemstat may turn tumors concealed from a patient s immune system called cold tumors  into hot tumors  our tumors  the immune system is able to identify and infiltrate.,0.002637468365719542,NEUTRAL
These now hot tumors could then respond to treatment with checkpoint inhibitors. This provides a significant opportunity for seclidemstat because it could be used to treat patients with a wide variety of cancers that are currently unresponsive to checkpoint inhibitors. As I said earlier  considering the data we have generated to date and the potential for additional data generation in ongoing clinical programs and soon to be announced additional clinical programs  these are exciting times for Salarius.,0.10670005320571363,NEUTRAL
Again  by midyear      this year  we hope to have active clinical trials across   patient populations  evaluating seclidemstat as single agent therapy and evaluating seclidemstat in up to   different combination therapies.,0.01931266754399985,NEUTRAL

I can t go into details  but we have seen a strong signal in patients. And based on that  these additional    to    patients will supplement that signal.

Hi  good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question and congratulations with the strong quarter and actually the strong year. So I just wanted to go back to Ewing sarcoma and Ewing-related sarcoma trial. So you have a combo with chemotherapy in second and third-line  and then you have a single agent for Ewing-related sarcomas in the third-line. So why did you decide not to combine Ewing-related sarcomas with chemo  just like you did with Ewing sarcoma itself ,0.4344131341204047,POSITIVE
David Arthur,0.00041129621968138963,NEUTRAL
Nadeem  would you like to take that one ,-0.14132830128073692,NEUTRAL
Nadeem Mirza,0.0027429148321971297,NEUTRAL
Yes  sure. It s a very valid question. So for the myxoid liposarcoma  there is -- there are two drugs that are currently approved. What we have observed in these patients as a single agent that those patients have failed those standard treatment and still had significant clinical activity.,0.13210880011320114,NEUTRAL
So we want to further establish single-agent activity for the myxoid liposarcoma. And if we are able to show what we observed in the preliminary  I think  it will be a relatively a good path to regulatory approval as a single agent. We do have some internal discussions have been going on. So we are looking at further combinations as well  but we re not ready to disclose them at this time.,0.006637806072831154,NEUTRAL
Regarding the FET translocation to sarcoma  there is no standard treatment for those patients. So - and these patients are treated with different chemotherapies and a different regimen. So it will be difficult to select a single or a couple of chemotherapy regimens that one would want to combine with.,-0.007859613513574004,NEUTRAL
And among those patients in the FET translocated patients who had failed multiple lines of prior treatments  chemotherapies and other agents  we have observed a significant clinical activity as a single agent and following the same logical path of thinking if we can show similar activity in additional patients that would be regulatory -- potential regulatory path for approval for a single agent.,0.001691286772256717,NEUTRAL
Aydin Huseynov,0.000810996803920716,NEUTRAL
Right. Appreciate that. And -- yes  you did. I just wanted to follow-up on that. So what do you see there as a success. Where does -- can you remind us what the standard of care stands for those   kind of groups of patients  Second  third-line in sarcoma and kind of third-line plus Ewing-related sarcoma. Is there kind of ORR specific number  Or is there overall survival number that you re targeting ,0.282252614852041,POSITIVE
Nadeem Mirza,0.0027429148321971297,NEUTRAL
Yes. So I cannot disclose what we are aiming for what we observe  but I can tell you what the benchmarks are for Ewing sarcoma. The benchmark is around   to   months median PFS. For myxoid liposarcoma  in earlier lines of patients  now I remember  we have patients that have failed with standard treatment but in myxoid liposarcoma  the range of median PFS is around  .  to   months. That s the median PFS.,-0.3098208084702492,NEGATIVE
For FET translocated sarcoma  as I mentioned  there s no clear good benchmark  but what we have observed when we looked at the literature  it averages around median of   to   months. And in our study  we have seen much  much significant prolongation of these progression-free survival time point.,-0.12295310571789742,MIXED

Nadeem Mirza,0.0027429148321971297,NEUTRAL
Well  yes  that will be a discussion with the health authorities. Based on those patients have exhausted all treatment options  if these patients represents a highly unmet need  and I think that regulators would take a view of that and when you present them with the data  showing that these patients have failed either standard treatments available or de facto standards that people use currently.,-0.09568407479673624,NEUTRAL
And once they have failed those treatments and yet single agent  seclidemstat provides additional benefit in terms of prolonging their time to tumor progression  I would certainly hope that the regulators would take that into account for potential approval.,0.015622593462467194,NEUTRAL
Aydin Huseynov,0.000810996803920716,NEUTRAL
Okay. All right. And for advanced solid tumors  are there indications that you see as the most promising in your opinion for seclidemstat  And are you planning to apply biomarker-based kind of selection work forward in the Phase II ,0.26830287091434,POSITIVE
David Arthur,0.00041129621968138963,NEUTRAL

Daniela Santiesteban,-0.001210726797580719,NEUTRAL
Yes. Happy to. So in our advanced solid tumor trial  we did enroll  as you know  these Ewing-related sarcoma patients. And based off the signal mentioned by David and Nadeem  is why we re now expanding the Ewing sarcoma trial to include these additional patients. So already  the FET solid tumor trial has given us an indication of patients that may respond better to seclidemstat.,0.40521154226735234,POSITIVE
In addition  we re conducting preclinical work to identify if there are sensitizing mutations to seclidemstat. That work is ongoing  and we hope to report results in the next few months.,0.10870190942659974,NEUTRAL
Aydin Huseynov,0.000810996803920716,NEUTRAL
All right. I appreciate that. And another question I have -- sorry  this is the last one. About the -- you mentioned the additive effect of chemotherapy and are you planning to share that data  Are you planning to publish that data  And if there is additional -- there is additive effect to chemotherapy  why wouldn t you try all the trials with chemotherapy instead of trying -- as a single agent ,-0.06816178560256958,NEGATIVE
David Arthur,0.00041129621968138963,NEUTRAL
So Daniela  why don t you start with the internal additive data and our plans to offer that and additional work  and then I ll address the second part of the question.,-0.18534819595515728,NEUTRAL
Daniela Santiesteban,-0.001210726797580719,NEUTRAL
Yes  happy to. So we have done in vitro experiments  combining the chemo regimen  topotecan and cyclophosphamide with seclidemstat and seen additivity. The mechanism there is topotecan and cyclophosphamide or DNA damage agents and LSD  has been implicated as well in the DNA damage response. And it may also expose more DNA through its chromatin reconfiguration to the effects of DNA damage and agents. So we feel quite strongly about combining with topotecan and cyclophosphamide from a mechanistic point of view.,0.33241493022069335,POSITIVE
But then also importantly  our safety profile does not have significant overlapping toxicity concerns with the chemo regimen  which means that moving forward in clinic  that s a good strategy as you don t have those overlapping talks concerns.,0.18294386751949787,NEUTRAL
And I ll let David mention why we re taking the strategy of continuing to pursue single agent and some of the other Ewing-related sarcomas before combining with chemo ,-0.015647921711206436,NEUTRAL
David Arthur,0.00041129621968138963,NEUTRAL
So Aydin  thanks for the question. The short answer is we have not taken anything off the table. We re going to follow the science and always try and do what s in the best interest of achieving the most positive in outcomes. So where we are now with the myxoid Ewing-related sarcomas  is we re following the results that we observed in the subset of patients. And we re fortifying those results with greater patient numbers. And by continuing in single agent therapy  as Nadeem mentioned earlier  if we see results that we re hoping to see  we could have potentially both a single agent and a combination therapy approach to treating those types of Ewing-related sarcomas.,0.28010236378759146,POSITIVE
While this is going on  our -- we re working here in our lab internally to identify what chemotherapy agents might be the best combination choices should we decide and head that direction. So looking back to my how I started the answer to the question  we re keeping all options on the table. But right now  we like the fact that we re pursuing single agent therapy and see where that takes us  which sets up the option of having in a number of directions in the near future.,0.25531109917210415,POSITIVE

Our next question comes from Hunter Diamond of Diamond Equity Research.,0.002377303666435182,NEUTRAL
Hunter Diamond,0.006206113146618009,NEUTRAL
Firstly  great presentation. I think one of the best ones I ve heard from you  David  and the management team and a lot of positive developments. My question relates to what do you view as the potential of seclidemstat in hematological malignancies  And what that is sort of driving that ,0.4976796900446061,POSITIVE
David Arthur,0.00041129621968138963,NEUTRAL
Hunter  thanks for the question. Daniela  would you like to take that ,0.39580254862084985,POSITIVE
Daniela Santiesteban,-0.001210726797580719,NEUTRAL
Yes  happy to. Thanks for the question  Hunter. So LSD  as a target has been well-validated for hem malignancies due to LSD  s role in blocking differentiation and then driving malignant cell growth. And we ve seen other companies with LSD  inhibitors showing clinical proof-of-concept in hem indications  specifically in AML.,0.4651089087128639,POSITIVE
At Salarius  what we ve done is we studied seclidemstat in a variety of heme malignancies  AML  myelodysplastic syndrome. And we ve seen that seclidemstat has an antiproliferative effect and also that it shows synergistic effects when combined with a commonly used agent in the space  azacitidine. And then as we mentioned before  one of the benefits of seclidemstat is that we have a manageable safety profile  and we have not seen significant heme talks that some of these other LSD  inhibitors will often face in clinics.,0.030502238776534796,NEUTRAL
So we think the combination of our activity in the preclinical model  coupled with our advantage in terms of more manageable heme safety profile will give us an advantage in pursuing seclidemstat within the hematological malignancy indication. And we re looking forward to formally announcing a trial in the space and initiating that trial in the next few months.,0.12908748543122783,NEUTRAL
Hunter Diamond,0.006206113146618009,NEUTRAL
Great. Thank you very much  Daniela  for the update. So my next question is maybe more high level. Obviously  the company is in the best financial position since we ve covered the company and in its history  and it has  as you stated money for existing trials. I guess I m just trying to understand -- and I don t know how much you can comment on this.,0.4772470482275821,POSITIVE
Obviously  you re very positive  as stated on the prospects of each subpopulation populations. How do you view the company as sort of -- are you looking at -- and I know I may have asked this before  but are you looking at sort of other assets to acquire at this point  Is it more of stuff would come inbound ,0.2721296325325966,POSITIVE
Or do you think there s just so many sort of prospects for a smaller public company at this point that you re just trying to advance sort of these new indications that you already have this quarter ,-0.3002214916050434,NEGATIVE
David Arthur,0.00041129621968138963,NEUTRAL
So Hunter  thanks for the question. The answer is  I m constantly looking at all areas that will first support the development of seclidemstat and ensure that we are maximizing its potential for patients and ultimately  shareholders. We re -- we want to do is best for patients and create value for shareholders. Now having said that  we re approached constantly by other organizations that have seen our ability to develop assets and advance them. And they want to talk to us about potentially assisting with their assets and moving them forward. So we take a lot of calls  we take a lot of meetings and I can t comment or commit one way or another of what might happen in the future.,0.2134753594873473,NEUTRAL
But first and foremost  it s all about seclidemstat. And -- but if the right opportunity were to come along to increase the pipeline. We d certainly evaluate that opportunity with full force.,0.03211413323879242,NEUTRAL
Hunter Diamond,0.006206113146618009,NEUTRAL
Absolutely. Yes. No  I m just thinking very high level because  as you know  there s only sort of a few companies where you play in epigenetics  right  I mean  you can almost count them on a hands  public companies that have access to funding. So I would think -- I guess what I m hearing is generally  you re feeling that there are a lot of opportunities if and when if something arises  It seems like it s a great time to be in the epigenetics market as a whole.,0.12362724170088768,NEUTRAL
David Arthur,0.00041129621968138963,NEUTRAL
I think it s an outstanding time. It s even better than great. It s an outstanding time. We have a genetic deal. There s -- there are a lot of companies that are developing other epigenetic drugs going after other targets. I think in the LSD  space or the LSD  inhibitor space  we re really well positioned. There are other companies that have recently announced preclinical programs in the LSD  space.,0.49302250854088925,POSITIVE
Many of them are pursuing reversibility in their LSD  inhibitor. So everything we re seeing at a high level indicates that we re heading in the right direction  and we just want to head down that path as quickly as we can.,0.023593295365571976,NEUTRAL
Hunter Diamond,0.006206113146618009,NEUTRAL

After an initial adjustment period where customers were focused on business continuity and employee safety  customers seem to recognize that this new normal compelled them to think differently about how they operate and which tools they would need to navigate a new reality. This has created opportunities for customers to realize meaningful value  opportunities for them to modernize a wide array of workloads and solidify Smartsheet as a core component in their enterprise software stack.,0.03689230067539029,NEUTRAL

I d like to talk about our solutions strategy for a moment. Over the last few years  our Accelerator strategy has helped customers increase the speed and agility of projects and processes and address targeted workflows.

Thank you  Mark. Overall  we were pleased with the results for the quarter  which reflected the continuation of improving business trends and large deal volume. I will now go through our financial results for Q  and fiscal year     . Unless otherwise stated  all references to our expenses and operating results are on a non-GAAP basis and are reconciled to our GAAP results in the earnings release and presentation that was posted before the call.,0.4184693320421502,POSITIVE
Our Q  results were positively impacted by an easing of COVID-related sales headwinds we saw earlier in the year  continued strength of larger transactions and a strong close to the fiscal year-end by our sales organization that was supported by a year-end customer budget benefit.,0.2679113537305966,POSITIVE
For our full-year       we ended with total revenue of     .  million  up     year-over-year  billings of     .  million  up     year-over-year  operating loss of     million and free cash flow of negative    .  million. We ended the year with annual recurring revenue of approximately      million.,-0.09532141033560038,NEUTRAL
Next I will provide more color on our fourth quarter financial results. As previously mentioned  fourth quarter revenue came in at     .  million  up     year-over-year. Subscription revenue cross the      million mark for the first time and it was     .  million  accelerating year-over-year growth to    . Services revenue was   .  million  representing year-over-year growth of    . The Brandfolder contribution to total revenue in the fourth quarter was    million exceeding our expectations.,0.21273508615558967,NEUTRAL
Now turning to billings. Fourth quarter billings came in strong at     .  million  which was an acceleration in the year-over-year growth rate to    . Brandfolder contributed   .  million to our billings number  which also exceeded our guidance. Approximately     of our subscription billings were annual with    monthly. Quarterly  semi-annual and multi-year billings represented    of the total.,0.10129938650061376,NEUTRAL
Moving on to our reported metrics. We now have        customers paying us        or more per year        paying         or more per year and     now paying us          or more per year. These customer segments now represent          and     respectively of total ARR. Our domain average ACV grew     year-over-year to       . We ended the quarter with a dollar-based net retention rate of     . The full churn rate improved and is now below   .,0.06726928055286407,NEUTRAL
You may notice that our billings number came in higher than our guidance  while our dollar-based net retention rate was in line with our expectations. This is due to a greater proportion of our billings this quarter coming from both new customers and expansion of customers that we acquired over the past year  neither of which would impact our Q  dollar-based net retention rate.,-0.129717661999166,NEUTRAL
For the first quarter  we expect our dollar-based net retention rate to remain around      as we lapped the first COVID-impacted quarter. Through the remainder of the year  we expect dollar-based net retention rate to trend moderately higher.,-0.05821298994123936,NEUTRAL
I d like to provide additional color on our progress with our large customer segment  which we defined as a customer with over        total employees. At the end of fiscal year       we had over       customers in this segment of which    had annual recurring revenue of            greater than          up from    a year ago. This customer ARR level represents an investment in the Smartsheet platform that encompasses a broad selection of our offerings.,0.08832013502251357,NEUTRAL
This large customer segment represents approximately a quarter of our current ARR with significant expansion potential. If we expanded the remaining domains in this cohort to the          ARR level  which we have shown an ability to do  the total ARR opportunity for this segment would be around   .  billion. Our strategy across all segments starts with organic adoption and subsequent expansion. This is seen in this segment as well  where a greater than     of these customers had ARR of less than        in their first year. This segment also exhibits higher expansion rates.,0.03495379176456481,NEUTRAL
As of Q   the dollar-based net retention rate for the over-      -employee customer segment was      higher than the rest of our customer population. Additionally  we are seeing significant active user growth in this segment  which also supports our conviction and while we continue to invest in features  products and packaging to further support our growth with large customers.,0.03576231375336647,NEUTRAL
As we think about the growth opportunity ahead  we have firmly established Smartsheet as the CWM solution of choice for enterprises with broad applicability for companies of all sizes. As shown earlier  we have a long growth runway ahead. We will continue to invest in our opportunity  and I look forward to providing additional details on our progress in the coming quarters.,0.21962326334323734,NEUTRAL
Now turning back to the financials. Our total gross margin was        percentage points better than the third quarter. As you ll recall  our gross margin was adversely impacted in Q  due to the presence of duplicative server costs associated with our migration to the public cloud. The completion of the migration in Q  meant that the duplicative costs did not repeat in Q . Our expectation for gross margin for the fiscal      is to be between     and     as we look at leveraging public cloud infrastructure internationally.,-0.3391737099736929,NEGATIVE
Overall  operating loss in the quarter was negative   .  million or    of revenue down from     of revenue a year ago. This was built on year-over-year leverage in all functional areas. Free cash flow was positive   .  million  which exceeded our guidance. Longer term  our model has the capability to generate significant cash flow at scale.,0.23131615668535233,POSITIVE
Now before I move on to guidance  a quick housekeeping item. In the past  we had reported out on our licensed user count at the end of each fiscal year. Recently  we have expanded our product offerings to include new products and packaging structures that provide us with new ways to monetize more of our user base. This is a trend we expect to continue. As it does  focusing on licensed users will understate our increasing ability to monetize our user base. Due to this evolution in our business  going forward  we will continue to report out on our total community size each quarter. However  we will no longer report out on our licensed user count.,0.026094822445884347,NEUTRAL
Now let me move on to guidance. Our fiscal year      guidance contemplates a gradual improvement in the macro environment in the second half of the year. This drives our expectation of billings seasonality that is weighted more towards the back half of the year. For the first quarter of fiscal year       we expect revenue to be in the range of      million to      million  billings to be in the range of      million to      million  non-GAAP operating loss to be in the range of     million to     million  and non-GAAP net loss per share to be between   .   and   .   based on weighted average shares outstanding of    .  million. Our net free cash outflow is expected to be in the range of     million to     million.,-0.025569320656359196,NEUTRAL
For the full fiscal year  we expect our revenues to be in the range of      million to      million  representing growth of     to    . We expect billings to be in the range of      million to      million  representing growth of     to    . We expect non-GAAP operating loss to be in the range of     million to     million  and non-GAAP net loss per share to be between   .   and   .   for the year based on approximately     million weighted shares outstanding. And we expect our free cash flow margin in fiscal year      to be between minus    and minus     an improvement from minus    in fiscal year     .,-0.04010375076904893,NEUTRAL
In closing  I would emphasize a few points in relation to our business. First  the Smartsheet business has diversified across segments  verticals and geographies with customer ARRs that range in size from a few hundred dollars to several million dollars. Second  our customer spending priorities grow and scale well with our solutions  and we will continue to invest in this opportunity. Third  with rapid innovation in our proprietary features and our M A over the past couple of years  we have significantly widened our competitive moat. And finally  we have an incredibly powerful distribution model with large community of over   million users. This positions us incredibly well to execute the fiscal year      plan and maintain our position as a leader in enterprise CWM.,0.1499282777949702,NEUTRAL

Hi. Thank you and congrats on a great quarter and a great end to the year. Mark  maybe this first one is probably for you. But you mentioned in your prepared remarks a little bit on the evolution of the solution strategy  and I was just wondering if you can maybe expand for us a little bit what the changes you are making to the solutions are and how   maybe how should we think about the impact that will have on your pricing strategy for some of those accelerators and other value-based capabilities ,0.4728632741025649,POSITIVE
Mark Mader,0.02983074262738228,NEUTRAL
Yes. Arjun  I think we ll take this as a two-parter  so I ll answer   I have a couple of comments  and I ll let Gene cover off. So I think two things we re trying to do is  is respond to customer signal. And when I think about what we did with accelerators in prior years  solving for very specific use cases  really letting people take advantage of this composite of our dashboards and our sheets and our reports and our forms  people like those. But the things that we re seeing is we re scaling further in the enterprise is a different set of needs. It can be on the dimension of scale and control  things for which we re actually developing proprietary IP. So technology is being built. It s way beyond just the configuration of a solution. So I ll let Gene speak to that in a second.,0.02373579889535904,NEUTRAL
The second piece around packaging and pricing  that s very important. Over the last few years as we ve created more and more capabilities  we have this ever-growing portfolio of things  and people want simplicity in how they engage with us. So for us to get our median sales rep to be able to sell quickly and confidently and let customers to be able to react to that well  there needs to be a simplicity in the offer. And that s what we re achieving now with the change in packaging as well as with this newly enhanced set of offerings. Gene ,0.34717973112128675,POSITIVE
Eugene Farrell,0.0006735474380548112,NEUTRAL
Yes. Building on Mark s comments  it s really a shift that we ve taken based on customer signal where   on the solutions side  customers are looking for the ability to really tailor solutions more precisely to their individual business needs  and they re looking for the ability that when they license a set of capabilities  being able to apply those capabilities across multiple use cases is a functional area. So for example  in marketing  we have an accelerator for event management  customers are saying   Hey  what I d really like is to be able to license a set of capabilities that will support marketing event management and campaign management and creative content development   and the list goes on.,0.05341849662363529,NEUTRAL
And so what we ve essentially done is look to a new packaging approach that takes our premium capabilities that will still be available as a la carte or individual capabilities. But we re now also offering them in a bundle or a package of premium platform capabilities that our customers can license at a significant discount or a value when they license the package versus buying them individually.,0.01513663586229086,NEUTRAL
And by positioning that platform  it really enables us to grow with less friction within customers because they then have the entire platform to be able to build on top of. And then it also changes how we monetize because we ve actually priced that premium offering based on the number of connected users to the actual platform. And so a company that has Smartsheet deployed within a department can license it at a price point that is commensurate with the value that they get at the department level. As they expand and add more connected users across the enterprise  renewal that will then relicense or expand that customer at a higher price point.,0.28658403758890927,POSITIVE
Arjun Bhatia,0.003358714107889682,NEUTRAL
Got it. That s very helpful. Thanks for the color. And then  Pete  maybe one for you  a little bit of an open-ended question. But after being in the CFO seat for    days now  it would be great if you can share with us some of your early observations about the business overall as a newer member of the leadership team. And then from a financial perspective  I know you mentioned the licensed user disclosure change  but curious if we should expect any other changes in disclosures going forward  Thank you.,0.4775705308711622,POSITIVE
Pete Godbole,-0.0007015283918008208,NEUTRAL
Arjun  thanks for the question. So first    days have flown by really fast. There s probably three takeaways for me. The first one is  you always hear the word TAM  and you have to actually feel it. So as I joined Smartsheet  actually using the product and figuring how it could work and actually did work was just a realization of that opportunity. You can see the TAM   you can see the TAM at play. I couldn t be in any more Zoom calls and get the work done.,0.4535598901566118,POSITIVE
The second one is  as I dug into the business  I have confidence in the business. I believe the opportunity is here. The long-term opportunity is our focus and our near-term investment should help us unlock it. So I believe that. And then the last part of it is the leadership team. I think for every opportunity  the leadership team is what unlocks it  and as I ve gone through this year of experienced leadership team that really knows how to take advantage of it and scale into that opportunity. So those are my three quick observations. The second part of your question was on metrics changing. We re not changing any metrics other than the one I specifically called out as a part of our housekeeping.,0.22917022072942927,NEUTRAL

Yes. Thanks. I want to echo the congratulations. Great quarter. Hi  Mark  Pete  Gene and Aaron. And also  I did like the disclosure around the larger enterprises with        plus employees. That was very helpful. I had two questions after all of that there. Mark  I tend to ask about where we are in just kind of the market itself  the collaborative work management market and its evolution. You ll have a lot more capabilities now  you have no-code apps  you have Bridge  you have all these other things that are kind of infrastructure oriented for enterprises. Are you seeing as we went through calendar      and how you think about       are you seeing much larger landings when you get into a new enterprise for the first time that you hadn t touched before or is the initial acquisition kind of size  is it changing much  And then I had a follow-up question.,0.42698748875409365,POSITIVE
Mark Mader,0.02983074262738228,NEUTRAL
Hi  Terry. I think we have the opportunity to land larger  but the beautiful thing is not a requirement  right. So if you have someone who really wants to accelerate right out of the gate and want to consume a premium platform thing with Brandfolder included and fully digitized a large workflow  they can do so. But I would say that the ability for them to maintain that optionality still remains critical. We still see evidence of teams within large departments at really large companies wanting to have that earned enterprise approach. So it s important as we come up with these new offerings  we re not forcing the customer s hand  we re giving them an option.,0.07887258566915989,NEUTRAL
And I think that s where as Gene said  the a la carte approach or the fully packaged bundle approach  I think it s something that is still very much needed. I would say  though  that with Brandfolder was a good example  where we had a couple of new wins that were in the high five figure range. And it s a wonderful performance by that team.,0.3484082728391513,POSITIVE
Terrell Tillman,0.00027041965222451836,NEUTRAL

Great quarter as well. I wanted to dig in into the large customer commentary. Maybe you can talk about  Mark  what is it that you think is the biggest bottleneck you have right now in taking these       customers that have        employees plus that on average spend with you  I don t know          and getting them into   .   million and   .   million  What is the main bottleneck  How much of that is product-driven versus go-to-market approach ,0.04639530926942825,MIXED
Mark Mader,0.02983074262738228,NEUTRAL
All right. So I think it is really a combination of the two. I mean  you can t round go without the product capabilities. But if you don t have the mechanisms  the sales muscle  the advisory service  the sort of a journey mapping for the customer  you re putting an intense amount of pressure on your prospect to your customer to figure that out on their own. So as we look at leaning in on our large enterprise team build-out  both with quota-carrying reps and with advisory services  those are things that we think are fundamental. So I would say  the bottleneck or the opportunity for growth is really in building that team out. I think we re doing all the right things on the platform piece to make it happen  but it s really building the team and also enabling partners to contribute to it.,0.060573071241378784,MIXED

I think in our prepared remarks  Melissa  we referenced the three things. We talked about less macroeconomic headwinds. We talked about the volume of larger transactions and the strong sales execution. Those were absolutely the case. We sort of covered those fairly well.

We appreciate the additional disclosure on the large customer side  whereas that number breaks out closer to     .

So I ll take the first part of it  and I ll let Mark speak a little bit to the second part of sort of how we are going after the opportunity. The way we discussed the opportunities  we said  we have       customers today who have more than        employees are already customers of ours. We have    of those who pay us greater than   .  million in annual recurring revenue.

Mark Mader,0.02983074262738228,NEUTRAL
Yes. I think in terms of the go-to-market  I think a big part of this is  is really marrying a very strong land and expand motion with an opinionated sales approach. So if we go into a larger customer that we know has significant needs across automation  customer enablement  planning  these are the things that we can come in with a solution set. We can assign a significant ROI to it  which would command a more significant level of investment. So I think the path to getting from      over   .  million contributors to dramatically increasing that is to have more of those pairings of the top-down guiding advisory  examining how we can best help  paired with that bottom up. And that s something which again  we re developing right now. A few years ago  it didn t exist at our company if the muscle has been built and now we need to scale.,0.1410782327875495,NEUTRAL

Keith Bachman,-0.0006826436438132077,NEUTRAL
Yes. Thank you. I wanted to ask two questions that are related and I think I ll direct them to Mark  if I could. Mark  first on the competitive landscape  I wanted to get an update on your thinking  And in particular  I think about how the market may unfold as it relates to RPA. Right now  you indicated you signed a recent partnership with UiPath  but how do you think that particular segment has the risk or opportunity of overlapping in the next couple of years ,0.24170641601085663,NEUTRAL

I m actually going to let Gene speak to this one.,0.05798407644033432,NEUTRAL
Eugene Farrell,0.0006735474380548112,NEUTRAL
Yes. Hi  Keith. I think that   yes  the question is really around where do we see RPA playing out around relative to our capabilities. And in doing the agreement with UiPath  it was really driven by a signal from   that both companies were receiving from customers where their workflows in modern enterprise that really cross between the more  what I ll call  routine kind of on-rails structured work into unstructured dynamic work  where you need to   you have a degree of variability that machines are not going to be able to adapt for and customer desire to be able to take workflows that maybe start in that structured space and they re using RPA to improve efficiency and throughput  and then be able to pass those off to an unstructured or dynamic workflow that s being managed at Smartsheet.,-0.015148758888244629,NEUTRAL
And I think you can actually work both ways. You can start in the unstructured side and move to structured and vice versa. I think your question is really around how do we see those converging. Well  I think there will be increasing marriage between those technologies as more and more companies find ways to leverage machine intelligence to really eliminate what I call kind of the no-brainer workflows that today are being done by humans mainly because systems can t talk to each other very well. I think that s very different than what s happening in the unstructured space where you really have to have that ability to adapt and change really  really quickly.,0.13312877714633942,NEUTRAL
And so I don t think there s ever a complete overlap. I think it s really a nice marriage going forward. And our goal is to be positioned as the platform of choice to be able to support the unstructured side of work.,0.3268764764070511,POSITIVE
Keith Bachman,-0.0006826436438132077,NEUTRAL
Okay. That makes perfect sense to me. The second question is on increasing your dollar penetration rates. If you look even at your largest customers  your dollar percent of spend per customer is still relatively low  and while it s been coming up nicely  I m just wondering how that moves more rapidly. And the area that I wanted to focus on is both the Accelerator strategy and the capability-based projects that you talked about in marketing as an example. But how do you think about that unfolding over the next two years to try to increase your dollar penetration  so to speak ,0.09686826914548874,POSITIVE
So in other words  if you look at accelerators now as a percent of your billings and you combine that two years from now with the marketing-based capabilities plus the extended family  how do you think that changes  And do you think that moves the needle on your dollar-based penetration of your customers ,-0.09088615700602531,NEUTRAL
Pete Godbole,-0.0007015283918008208,NEUTRAL
Yes. So let me kind of break this down. I think there s really a couple of different elements to it. I think it starts with some of the things Mark talked about around how do we be more intentional and more opinionated in helping customers accelerate their journey. COVID has provided this amazing opportunity where companies are realizing that they kind of business as usual in the way they ve been operating for years. It s likely not going to be the preferred way to operate as we come out of the pandemic.,0.09747949987649918,MIXED
And so there s a real catalyst for folks to rethink and companies to rethink how they re operating. So I think us being positioned to really help guide them on that journey through our sales and support services  is probably at the tip of the sphere. To support that  I think there s really two key elements of our offerings. The first is in the platform   premium platform capabilities we ve talked about.,0.15620389697141945,NEUTRAL
One of the things we ve learned over time with customers is that when you sell against a specific solution or a specific need  customers drive a lot of value from that. But then many times immediately say  hey  this works so well here  I want to go pivot to the next use case. And when they just licensed a subset of our platform  they re not always able to solve for that beautifully. So we have to come back and relicense or it creates friction in the process which slows down expansion and their ability to drive value from Smartsheet.,-0.02939865179359913,MIXED
So shifting to a more holistic premium platform approach  we think really is going to take the brakes off of our customer s ability to extend Smartsheet and the value we create across the enterprise more quickly and solve for a broader set of use cases in a lower friction way. The third thing  I would mention is Work Apps and the no-code capabilities that that introduces. We are seeing really positive signal from customers. It s still very early  and there s a lot of   lot that we re bringing to market over the course of this year to really enable Work Apps to be deployed at scale and manage at scale. But we really see that ability to create curated experiences around workflows and specific use cases as truly differentiating and really empowering because it s a true no-code platform where business users are able to build and configure these solutions and deploy them really  really quickly  and then modify or adjust when businesses present.,0.1332269124686718,NEUTRAL
So I think the combination of the intentional and advisory go-to-market with our platform and our Work Apps capabilities  I think they are really the key to accelerating that journey to large ARR customer.,0.1625276751583442,NEUTRAL

You have larger caps as evidenced by Adobe and Citrix  wanting to participate. So I think there s really strong agreement that there s growth opportunity.

Hey  thanks guys. Congrats on a strong finish to the year. Mark  I want to kind of build on Scott s last question  right  If I think back a couple of quarters ago  it seemed to me like the transactional business was really healthy. The enterprise stayed fairly strong  but there was kind of a blip with expansion of customers in the middle  right  And I think the numbers would suggest you re seeing some recovery in Q . But I just want to ask explicitly about kind of what you re seeing with that expansion business in the middle customer cohort. And if it is  in fact  getting better  was it just time and recovery  Or is there something that you did to kind of affect change there ,0.3569803684949875,POSITIVE
Mark Mader,0.02983074262738228,NEUTRAL
I think one of the things that I m really pleased to see is that both at the larger customer segment  really all up and down the stack  we re seeing a shortening of sales cycles again. So if we had   we re down about     to     from what we saw in Q   and that s a really good indicator. So I look at velocity as a really important factor. And it s not just velocity of the over        employees  it s all the way down to emerging companies. So that s a really positive trait that we re able to monitor. So I think the   in terms of the number of transactions  I think  we re   that the ability to simplify one s offerings  I think are a huge  huge input to achieving a different result. I do think macro is important too. We are still coming out of COVID  where hopefully vaccinations continue to go smoothly.,0.4286255685146898,POSITIVE
But I think making what we do  what s within our control easier for people to consume is probably as large of an impact. So I think we re making right choices there.

Mark Mader,0.02983074262738228,NEUTRAL
Well I think that the most obvious and the one that we re most excited about right now is really  I ll call it kind of disrupting traditional PPM. Almost every company has an element of project program  process management  and it s something   that s a significant use case for us today  but an area where the work we re doing with        feet and Smartsheet  we think  and some of the newer stuff that s in the pipeline  we have a real opportunity to disrupt there and really deliver pretty transformational experience for our customers that really moves away from a lot of the limitations of kind of the legacy platforms in that space. So that s an area that we re focused on and we ll be launching something later this year.,0.10208964347839355,NEUTRAL

I m wondering how tangible maybe are any signs that this whole category of collaborative work management  perhaps it wasn t the immediate pandemic response category  but that   maybe it was something that was just destined to happen a little later in the cycle. And companies have a little more time to think about getting work done outside of Zoom  as Pete referenced. And maybe they re getting a little more visibility into the distribution of their workforces  how it ll settle out.

Mark Mader,0.02983074262738228,NEUTRAL
Yes. I d love to see that extra wave develop. I think  what  there is recognition of is that synchronous communication. They re sort of an upper bound to what people can handle. I mean  I am on Zoom a lot and I would say it s an essential part of my day  but I also recognize  and I think customers are recognizing that is not the only tool that we can lean on to actually conduct business. So I think this notion of asynchronous work  the ability to track something  mechanize something and not have to rely on a live conversation is very important. I think we are   as we talked about a couple of earnings calls ago  we talked about the phases  right  Phase one was react  support  make sure people are safe  synchronous  synchronous  synchronous. And now we re entering that phase of async is absolutely here and people are going to make investments in it.,0.40650166291743517,POSITIVE

I think in other growth markets for us  Pete alluded to the extension of our cloud platform over in Europe. We re seeing opportunity with larger cap European companies who I would say are more conservative around the data residency front. And I think having done all the work on moving to public cloud last year  the lift we have to achieve that this year is a far less. Still a lift  but we are really well positioned for that. So I would highlight those as probably the two biggest opportunities.,0.25715255131945014,POSITIVE

Hey  thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you could kind of unpack the billings guidance for the full-year a little bit  obviously you re guiding to a nice reacceleration off of the growth you put up this year. And I imagine you re assuming churn rates kind of improve. There s probably some impact from the acquisition you made. But maybe just help us understand kind of what are the bigger factors driving that improved outlook  particularly the accelerated trajectory ,0.0264146625995636,NEUTRAL
Pete Godbole,-0.0007015283918008208,NEUTRAL
So we were really pleased with our billings performance in Q   and it spoke to some of the indicators that are important to this business. As we re thinking about this business in fiscal year       there s two elements that are important. As you think of billings  you should think of them as renewals  expansions and new business. So we are feeling really bullish on the expansions and new business based on our Q  performance and the trend we re carrying forward.,0.3500062432140112,POSITIVE
On the renewals that creates   renewals from last year are based on bookings that we did in fiscal year       which represents a renewable opportunity for us in fiscal year      and therefore billings in fiscal year     . We look at that headwind we had in  what I call fiscal year       and that s going to play itself out into our billings for fiscal year     . So on the sum of it  I would say  really positive on the new business and expansion billings and a headwind on the billings from last year that carry forward. Now that headwind will probably be more manifest in the first half of the year rather than the full-year and then sort of ease out or normalize.,0.028995072469115257,NEUTRAL

I would like to offer some brief thoughts on our fourth quarter results  but more importantly  discuss where the business has been since the beginning of the year as that recovery continues to strengthen.,0.016798559576272964,NEUTRAL
Finally  I will discuss our near-term development plans. It was March           when Ohio s Governor ordered all restaurants to close their dining rooms and bars and within a week  most states followed suite. It has been a journey since then for our industry and for our company. I m pleased to launch this conference call by reporting that so far for the first quarter through March           our consolidated comparable sales on a two-year basis have increased  .    albeit  we are still limited by many restrictions.,0.41315254173241556,POSITIVE
We are pleased with a strong momentum and feel hopeful for the future as governmental capacity restrictions have begun to further relax in many of our key markets  California  Nevada  Minnesota  Nashville. For example  starting on March           Las Vegas is changing to     capacity. To put it in perspective with our  ph  Las Vegas  for the first quarter through March           our consolidated comparable sales on a two-year basis increased  .  .,0.42934221879113466,POSITIVE
As we discussed in our last conference call  we began the fourth quarter with encouraging trends in October  as exhibited by positive comparable sales across both STK and Kona Grill  resulting in a consolidated increase of  .   for the month. This was largely a result of us reaching our highest indoor dining capacity since the pandemic began of    .,0.05396817112341523,NEUTRAL
However  as dining restrictions were reinstated over the course of the fourth quarter  comparable sales trends naturally soften  resulting in an   .   decrease in November  and a   .   decrease in December at the consolidated level.,-0.022988416254520416,NEUTRAL
Additionally  in November and December  we typically have a very large events business across our restaurants. Due to COVID restrictions  we were unable to host large events in the quarter. Still  we were very pleased with our teams for doing such a great job of managing through the decreased dining capacity and comparable sales headwinds  while containing costs.,0.4230682719498873,POSITIVE
It is also worth mentioning that takeout and delivery comprised approximately     of sales during the fourth quarter  which has almost tripled compared to the first quarter of     . We attribute the success to our investments in technology  which has enabled our guests to order for curbside pickup or delivery from nine separate delivery partners.,0.2313092047115788,NEUTRAL
To help drive takeout sales  we have adapted our menus particularly  STK  to have more transportable items that work in a takeout environment. This has certainly gone a long way towards elevating this channel and we are confident that off-premises sale will remain a meaningful and high margin layer of the business going forward  even as we welcome more and more guests back into the dining rooms.,0.2962419100222178,POSITIVE
There is no denying that guests are increasingly eager to return to normal life to the extent possible and for many that includes visiting full service restaurants for a great night out.,0.4675797598902136,POSITIVE
The fine dining experience that we offer is particularly attractive to so many people  because it s really a differentiated fun and vibrant experience compared to other higher end steak houses and upscale casual restaurants.,0.4953740401833784,POSITIVE

Moving on  one of the biggest cost advantages of our business is our emphasis on digital marketing relative to our peers. We have over  .  million people in our Friends with Benefits database  and we ll be enhancing our loyalty program later this year  merging into a new program that we ll be calling the VIBE Society. We also have other digital assets across Facebook  Instagram  and LinkedIn that have enabled us to stay on top of mind with our guests.,0.14560476609040052,NEUTRAL
And we never went dark  even in the worst of the pandemic  rather  we have always made sure that our guests knew that we were out there and eager to serve them  whether through delivery or takeout or even within our restaurants if possible.,0.17814163863658905,POSITIVE

And the bigger picture  this was frankly a result of our commitment to stay true to our core business model of owning the holidays.,0.42640073160873726,POSITIVE
Looking at Kona growth  specifically  the brand generated an  .   increase in comparable sales in October  but trailed off in November and December  as capacity restrictions were reinstated. Still  for the full quarter comparable sales declined only     which exceeded most other polished casual dining chains. We attribute throughout this outperformance of at Kona Grill to our strategies implemented since the acquisition.,0.019774019718170166,NEUTRAL

Our topline initiatives have also been complemented by better restaurant execution of the guest experience. Lastly  our Kona Grill suburban footprint has been a competitive advantage  particularly in the current environment.,0.36624965860391967,POSITIVE
Now  some additional comments on     . We are encouraged that our sales trends have improved since the onset of the New Year. Our dining capacity rose to     in January  which marked an improvement from December and correspondingly  our January consolidated comparable sales declined   .  .,0.20149493589997292,POSITIVE

As cities began to reopen  consolidated comparable sales for January  February  and March through the   th  continue to sequentially improve.

Ryan Meyers,-0.0006906198104843497,NEUTRAL
Hey guys  thanks for taking my questions. First one for me. So  the commentary that you gave in the press release on capacity and comps was pretty helpful  so appreciate that. Just wanted to get some insight on do you guys think that January was the trough here and then how are you sort of thinking about the business for the rest of the year and kind of which one is seeing the better recovery that STK or the Kona  Just kind of any sort of commentary on that would be helpful.,0.4398820415372029,POSITIVE
Manny Hilario,0.045305497478693724,NEUTRAL
Great. Sure. So  from what we ve seen so far this year  I would agree that January was what I considered to be a transitional month. I think that in January  we did see the impact of pretty cold weather across the country and being in locations with only outdoor facilities was very challenging I would think. So  I believe starting in February that we saw a little bit better weather patterns and also the lifting of restrictions.,0.2881221445277333,POSITIVE
So  what we ve seen in January  February  and March has been an ongoing pattern of the restrictions being lifted. We also have some additional lifting coming up  for instance  New York is shortly going to be at      which is a big market for us. We also have Vegas coming to     very soon. So  I would say that we re now on a more positive momentum going forward  particularly as the restrictions continue to be lifted.,0.2699529188685119,POSITIVE
Relative to STK and Kona Grill  my experience so far since we ve been in recovery mode is that both of them have done exceptionally well. Meaning that there s a lot of demands. I do believe that Kona Grill  because of its suburban exposure  just do very well  all seven days of the week  whereas STK  with less of business travellers and group dining is doing very well Thursday through Sunday. So  there s a little bit of a shift on how the customers use the brand.,0.4188217220362276,POSITIVE
But overall  I believe that both brands have done extremely well  particularly as you look at the numbers that we reported for the month of March. So  I m very pleased with both STK and Kona Grill and feel pretty strong about their continued recovery for the rest of the year.,0.49765836046572076,POSITIVE
Ryan Meyers,-0.0006906198104843497,NEUTRAL
Great  that s helpful. Next one for me. So  can you kind of walk through the cadence of new openings and if they re going to be licensed or company-operated  and then also the    units you expect to open here in       how many of them are Kona Grills ,0.4444034944754094,POSITIVE
Manny Hilario,0.045305497478693724,NEUTRAL
So  the cadence is -- just to reiterate  we opened Scottsdale STK  which is doing fantastic as you probably saw the numbers on the press release and as we discussed here. So  we ve been very happy with that and so that opened January  th. The next opening that we re having will be probably Bellevue  Washington  which is the next one that we have scheduled.,0.4633126487606205,POSITIVE
And then thereafter  we have a Cabo location in Mexico and then we have some U.K. locations after that. Obviously  the U.K. is still currently not allowing for indoor dining. I believe that they are -- or at least they were planning to go to outdoor dining in April  then going to dining in May. So  we probably will open those U.K. locations in June or slightly later  depending on when the restrictions get lifted there.,-0.20711986254900694,NEUTRAL
And then the three F B restaurants that we mentioned on our prepared remarks  we probably will be opening them late second quarter  early third quarter  again  depending on how the market conditions are. So  that s kind of the spread  I would say  that we ll open the majority of those locations by the end of the third quarter this year.,-0.024664588272571564,NEUTRAL

Ryan Meyers,-0.0006906198104843497,NEUTRAL
Okay  that s helpful. And then last one for me. So  as you ve seen  sort of  capacity restrictions ease and things get a little bit better  have you guys had any trouble bringing on more employees  whether it s bartenders  waiters  or chefs or anything like that  have you guys faced any sort of headwinds there as capacity has begun to tick back up here ,0.09971746057271957,POSITIVE
Manny Hilario,0.045305497478693724,NEUTRAL
I mean  generally  the answer is no  we haven t seen any dramatic shifts so far. Obviously  we re monitoring very closely the fact that unemployment benefits have once again been extended. And last time when that happened  it was a little bit more difficult to staff some of the positions  so clearly  we will benefit. I will  I should say  we actually will monitor that condition very closely.,-0.0028255265206098557,MIXED
I will tell you though the thing that we have seen those the people who are in the restaurants now are staying  so we ve seen a decrease -- a relative decrease in turnover and retentions have gone up. So  I would say that s probably the offset to maybe some of those future pressures on getting people in as that the people who are working for us seem to stay with the company. So  I m very bullish about the retention trend.,-0.1343222400173545,NEUTRAL
And I also think the fact that our operations have been very busy  I think the employees that are working in the restaurants feel very  very good about being in an active environment. So  I get a lot of compliments.,0.44828744197729975,POSITIVE
And frankly  a lot of our employees will come up to me and tell me that it s good to be in an environment that gets them away from what they consider to be the general  seclusion from the pandemic. So  employees seem to want to come to work because that gives them an escape from other situations outside of work. So  I think that s been very positive.,0.4388951340224594,POSITIVE

Our next question comes from the line of Nicole Miller with Piper Sandler. You may proceed with your question.,0.0037184044485911727,NEUTRAL
Nicole Miller,0.00025150040892185643,NEUTRAL
Thank you. Three questions. But they re all around the same idea of optimization. So  ask them the best that I can. But I m thinking first about the guest behavior and things you ve had to do to modify  And then of course what used to be normal. So  how do you optimize getting in the perfect guest in the door and optimize the facility  Is that day a week  day part  entr e mix  food versus alcohol  How are you thinking about optimizing that ,0.29227469954639673,POSITIVE
Manny Hilario,0.045305497478693724,NEUTRAL
So  that s a great question  Nicole. I think the way that we think is -- I told you a year and a half ago that things like selling the incremental drink at the table and selling the dessert at the table were something that we looked forward  because that would increase the per person average spend at the table.,0.08784541487693787,NEUTRAL
I think in today s environment  we think more of table turn. So  we really think about getting you in and out at an STK in    minutes. And for Kona Grill  we target   . So  I think it s more of the new reality is that it s all about table turns and getting people to -- particular the dinner timeframes.,0.10446792375296354,NEUTRAL
And then the other paradigm that s different is that even for a fine dining type of business like STK  where in the past  we would have looked at maybe brunch as a non-core business  we now look at brunch as a core business  because now it allows us to use less seats on a Sunday and on a Saturday  which are very high demand days. So  I think that brunch now is playing a key role in kind of how we think of the business long-term.,0.03233811631798744,NEUTRAL
And then last but not least  I think  from an operations and execution perspective  our teams spend a lot more time just measuring and monitoring the steps of service at the table. And we really do very rigorous review of how long it takes for the order to be taken and cocktails to get to the table.,0.08365938626229763,NEUTRAL
So  a very disciplined approach to bringing in the steps of service at the exact times  and obviously  we ll always have to balance that with the fact that we don t want to diminish the experience with the gap. So  it s really balancing the need for turns with need for a smile and move on  ph  a separate table.,0.2859119884669781,POSITIVE
Nicole Miller,0.00025150040892185643,NEUTRAL
Okay. And then I was also thinking about optimization through the lens of development. And clearly  you ve outlined a pipeline today. So  that s super helpful. But how did you optimize like  less capital-intensive license throwing off cash flow opportunity  with STK big box big revenue with the Kona mainstream  but a lot of whitespace  How did you go through that process in these conditions to optimize that ,0.06152544915676117,NEUTRAL
Manny Hilario,0.045305497478693724,NEUTRAL
I think a couple of things. So  on the development side  it s what I m seeing from an optimization perspective  if you will  is that particularly for F B hotel operators  I m seeing with the lower occupancy rates  they re less -- we -- less willing to take the risk on the F B side.,-0.12058727815747261,NEUTRAL
What I mean by that is that the last thing they want to do is take a business that already has low occupancy and potentially low RevPAR and throwing their high risk  if you will  restaurants or F B operations and particularly  if there are a shop that uses lots of labor for F B. so  I m seeing a lot of people wanting to optimize their F B footprint by bringing in people that can execute the F B program at a very high economic or very -- or I would actually say very profitable economics for them  so I see optimization there.,-0.31226547434926033,NEGATIVE
And then the other thing that we see on the optimizations  some of the hotels that we re in  because of the velocity and the fact that our restaurants are very full on Fridays and Saturdays  we become an amenity to the property where people would want to come to the hotel and stay overnight because it s so fun and exciting.,0.3132267873734236,POSITIVE
I m thinking  for instance  the W in LA is an example where we re at that hotel and we have  frankly  become as the hotel management  they will tell us  one of the key strengths of their business because we re actually super active and bring a lot of excitement there.,0.2399191295262426,NEUTRAL
In terms of Kona Grill growth relative to development  as I said earlier  we re being very  very careful about making sure that the first Kona Grill that we do is a super homerun. So  we ve been very disciplined about the entry in real estate that we have received tremendous amounts of opportunities from existing landlords who now want us to look at other projects and see if there is an opportunity for Kona Grill.,0.04792662151157856,NEUTRAL
I have seen them starting to begin to offer much more TIs on the Kona Grill  so almost going to a point where they re telling you they could almost build a property for us. But frankly  right now  because of where we re at on the pipeline with STK  and there s so much demand there for that product  we are focusing on it. And obviously  we will only take any kind of look at a Kona Grill if it s an extraordinary level of economics.,-0.05378064885735512,MIXED
So  I don t know if that answers your question  but certainly tells you that there s a lot of demands and we certainly want to focus on where there is higher level of returns and we certainly don t want to take any opportunities that we feel are not high revenue opportunities.,-0.06906604021787643,NEUTRAL
Nicole Miller,0.00025150040892185643,NEUTRAL
Well  and it helps us understand the consumer behaviors and what s going on out there -- on out there. So  it s super helpful. Last one  I m going to leave it open-ended  purposely so answer or not whatever drops in  but how do you optimize your balance sheet  I mean that could -- I ll just leave it at that. It ties together with the other parts. Thanks.,0.46118780062533915,POSITIVE
Manny Hilario,0.045305497478693724,NEUTRAL
Yes  I mean  I think right now optimizing the balance sheet is I think  emphasizing store level economics. I mean ultimately  in the restaurant business  that s how you ultimately really build your balance sheet is by having a world-class economics. And I think if you start looking at it -- look at our -- if you look at our same-store performance for STK  and unit economics back in new stores in Scottsdale at          weekly levels  our unit economics are super-compelling. So  our restaurants  at those volumes of those levels of revenue become super profitable. So  that s ultimately our long-term strategy to bring in capital.,0.06218799389898777,NEUTRAL
And as I said earlier in my comments about development  I think that the success of the brands today excites landlords and developers. So  having an exciting brands that are great amenities to projects to me is  frankly  the ultimate balance sheet builder because we will be able to get amazing deals and create a tremendous amount of cash flow with very little capital outlays.,0.3978161874692887,POSITIVE
So  that s how I look at the short-term capital view in this and then hopefully  as we continue building profitability  we ll be able to work out the cost of debt and other cost of capital in our balance sheet. So  ultimately  that s our really long-term -- longer term strategy for the balance sheet.,0.034224897623062134,NEUTRAL
So  focused on store margins  keep managing G A super tightly  and then ultimately  keep developing on asset light. So  that s our basic strategy that we ve been following.,0.005838964134454727,NEUTRAL
Nicole Miller,0.00025150040892185643,NEUTRAL

Our next question comes from the line of Abhishek Malani with Black Diamond Capital. You may proceed with your question.,0.005122860427945852,NEUTRAL
Abhishek Malani,0.00045063928700983524,NEUTRAL
All right. Thank you for taking my questions. I had a couple. To start  can you give us a bit more color on the capacity constraints  I know you mentioned that STK typically has more demand on the Thursday to Sunday window. But are restaurants actively turning down potential guests use space limitations  And so what s the demand pressure effectively seen  And is there a sense of implied capacity that restaurants have hit without coronavirus-related capacity constraints ,0.3058761591091752,POSITIVE
Manny Hilario,0.045305497478693724,NEUTRAL
I mean  so I would answer that question by saying that on Fridays  Saturdays  and Sundays  particularly between      and      in the evening  I would say that all of our restaurants are receiving lots more demand that we can fulfill in that timeframe. So  yes  so in those timeframes  I would say that we have received extraordinary amount of demand.,-0.025960303843021393,NEUTRAL
And frankly  our strategy has been through our -- how we book reservations. And how even we market  we try to shift all the -- a lot of that volume to the      to    timeframe  and then try to also shift some of the volume to the      frame. So  the answer is yes  those days are absolutely no problems.,0.21413406101055443,NEUTRAL
I do believe though that on the Mondays through Wednesdays  where historically  there were more business travellers  there s more conventions  there were more business type of activities  I think those are the days that we probably have more available capacity.,-0.007101684808731079,NEUTRAL
So  what we ve done in those days  if you re following what we do on marketing is  we ve been doing a tremendous amount of social type of activities  like date nights  on Mondays  Tuesdays  and Wednesdays  because that s one of the occasions that we see super high demand for right now. So  we re marking for that and I think that actually has been successful to fill in for some of the lack of demand from the business opportunities.,0.20246155187487602,NEUTRAL
Abhishek Malani,0.00045063928700983524,NEUTRAL
Awesome and going into a second question  slightly different. Can you give us a sense on what percentage of sales are coming from like  drinks versus entr es in this period versus in the pre-COVID period  Is there any difference here that we haven t seen ,0.21883271262049675,POSITIVE
Manny Hilario,0.045305497478693724,NEUTRAL
Yes  so I will say that  historically  pre-COVID  our liquor sales would be a     plus range  whereas in the COVID period  we ve been in between     and     on liquor and wine. I will tell you that pre-COVID with a number of being a little bit less than      I would have been very concerned. But in the post-COVID  considering that when you sell more drinks  particularly at the table  you tend to slow down your turn times at the table.,0.013026494532823563,MIXED
So  in our higher volume restaurants  particularly between Friday -- on Friday  Saturday  and Sundays  although we d like to sell liquor because that s good margin  we will trade having more turns on the table than holding a table back for an extra    minutes or two  and the waiters  ph  can have a drinks.,0.026621084660291672,NEUTRAL
So  a lot of the reason why the liquor mix might be a little bit less is because we are actually driving a different strategy to try to drive more traffic and bring more people through table turns.,-0.15124023612588644,NEUTRAL
So  I done think  per se  I guess what I m trying to not make the correlation is that we have less liquor sales  because we re in COVID  I don t think it s that  per se  it s -- I think it s a combination of the strategy of turning the tables and also the fact that some of the areas  we re still not able to use bar  which used to be also a place where people would come in just to have one or two drinks.,-0.21707001235336065,NEGATIVE
So  I think the combination of that is what drives it down. But if you look at our -- in general  if you look at our historical results  we ve actually been very well managing crowds and I don t think that that s really a big material impact for us in the long-term.,0.021230367943644524,MIXED
Abhishek Malani,0.00045063928700983524,NEUTRAL
Great. And one last question from me. First off  congratulations on the takeout and delivery execution. I was wondering here do we have a sense on what percent of these deliveries and takeout orders are from the current customers versus new adds ,0.4793380149640143,POSITIVE
Manny Hilario,0.045305497478693724,NEUTRAL
So  that s a fantastic question. So  -- because we re very early on the strategy  actually a large proportion of our transactions are new transactions we ve been very actively promoting. So  we re still in early stages of heavily promoting it. So  I would say that a big portion of it is just new transactions.,0.22499704221263528,NEUTRAL
For instance  we ve used some of the -- for instance  we use the cheeseburger as a key product to drive interest for STK. And when I say cheeseburger  I mean  a Wagyu Cheeseburger  probably the best -- one of the best hamburgers -- or cheeseburgers in the industry.,0.41693797055631876,POSITIVE
So  we re using promoting to bring people in. And so I think  at least in the early stages where we re at on takeout and delivery  I would say that over     of the traffic is still coming from people trying the product.,-0.2600309932604432,NEGATIVE
And frankly  I looked at as a huge opportunity because as I talk to our teams here  our trick is to make sure that through great experience and takeout and delivery  we convert those to long-term loyal customers. So  I see that as a great opportunity to really build a very robust takeout business and delivery business in the long-term.,0.3268236239964608,POSITIVE
Abhishek Malani,0.00045063928700983524,NEUTRAL
I m sorry to quickly add  so do you think there s any meaningful difference in the types of customers who are doing takeout and delivery versus the customers that are coming in-store ,-0.26442666351795197,NEGATIVE
Manny Hilario,0.045305497478693724,NEUTRAL
I think that they are -- lots of them are the same customers  but different occasions. So  they re -- it s a more casual occasion. So  I would say -- and it s also a mix of new people who are looking at the different products on the takeout  delivery menus.,-0.03369496762752533,NEUTRAL
And if you follow our menus  they tend to be lower price points. So  it s also an opportunity for other guests to try the brand. So  I think we re basically doing both  we re serving existing restaurants -- I mean existing customers for different occasion  and bring a tremendous amount of customers with a lower price points  particular STK  to introduce them to the brand.,0.06734037771821022,NEUTRAL
And we re totally okay with that because as we tell the team here is let them try with the takeout menu and then when they have the birthday or the special date  or the -- or any other holiday  which is one of our areas that we do very well  they ll remember us and they ll give us a nod on the holidays.,0.23727993294596672,POSITIVE
So  we look -- or special occasions. So  we look even at the consumer that may not be a primary STK consumer  as a potential consumer on a special occasion later on.,-0.02787855453789234,NEUTRAL

On slide   is an overview of our domestic Agriculture segment. We are seeing much improved farmer sentiment due to the progressive strength in commodity prices through our fourth quarter and continuing to date.,0.26599440979771316,POSITIVE
In addition to the stronger commodity prices  favorable yields in much of our ag footprint combined with USDA payments  led to improved net farm income for calendar year     . Additionally  fall harvest conditions were ideal for most of our farm and ranch customers to get their fields in great shape for the upcoming spring planting season.,0.29281777184223756,POSITIVE
Our business is well positioned to support the aging fleet of equipment with our focused parts and service strategy. We continue to pursue consistent growth in parts and service revenue  which is supporting strong gross profit margins and a healthy pre-tax income contribution.,0.16030288022011518,NEUTRAL
In addition to the stronger net farm income and improved farmer sentiment  we continue to see replacement demand  precision technology and connected machines as ongoing catalysts for new equipment purchases. As a result  we anticipate the momentum within our ag segment to continue throughout our fiscal     .,0.14949011208955199,NEUTRAL
Turning to slide    you will see an overview of our domestic construction segment. Although our construction equipment segment continues to feel the economic impact of COVID  we are seeing improving industry trends due to low interest rates  economic stabilization  net farm income growth  improved oil prices and continued optimism for future infrastructure investment.,0.13004609392373823,NEUTRAL
The operational improvements that our team has implemented over the past couple of years  produced improved fourth quarter pre-tax profits and full year adjusted pre-tax income.,0.3446682156791212,POSITIVE
Late in the fiscal fourth quarter  we divested two of our CE stores in Phoenix and Tucson Arizona. Not only will this be advantageous to our CE segment profitability  but also supports our strategy of operating and acquiring locations in core markets  where we can leverage logistics similar equipment specifications and customer synergies.,0.1491352564189583,NEUTRAL
Before we turn to slide    International overview  I want to share a couple of comments on the ERP implementation  which impacts our domestic ag and CE business. We have been successfully operating one pilot store in our new ERP platform since July      with an expected full rollout in the next    months.,0.024675783497514203,NEUTRAL

Thanks  Bryan. Turning to Slide  . Our total revenue for the fiscal      fourth quarter was     .  million  an increase of   .   compared to last year. Exceptional strength in our equipment business was the main driver of the strong revenue results in our fourth quarter  which increased   .  . While we experienced solid equipment growth in both our Agriculture and Construction segments  Agriculture was particularly strong  due to the improved end market conditions Bryan discussed earlier.,0.45198423275724053,POSITIVE
As I mentioned on the call   on the last call  we had very difficult comps for our fourth quarter parts and service businesses  where parts and service were up   .   and   .   respectively  due to the very difficult harvest conditions. This past fall s harvest was quite different  as weather conditions allowed for a much quicker harvest with less stress on equipment. As a result  parts sales were down  .   and service was up  .   in our current year fourth quarter.,-0.2664366252720356,NEGATIVE
Our rental and other revenue remained under pressure due to headwinds within our Construction segment and decreased   .   in the fourth quarter. As a result  we experienced a     basis point compression in our rental fleet dollar utilization from     in the fourth quarter last year to   .   in the current quarter. Rental revenue was also down due to a smaller fleet size where we ended the year at    .  million compared to     .  million in the prior period.,-0.09829974919557571,NEUTRAL
On Slide    our gross profit for the quarter increased by   .   to    .  million  due to the significant increase in our revenue.

In the fourth quarter of fiscal       our International segment revenue was    .  million. The decline of  .   compared to the prior year period was the result of lower equipment revenue caused by the industry conditions Bryan discussed earlier  partially offset by an increase in parts and service revenue.,-0.09915266162715852,NEUTRAL

Turning to slide   . Here we provide an overview of our balance sheet highlights at the end of the year. We had cash of     million as of January           which is higher than normal due to the very strong cash generation in fiscal year      that I will discuss in a few minutes. Our equipment inventory at the end of fiscal      was     .  million  a decrease of     .  million from January         . This substantial decrease in both new and used equipment inventories was a result of strong end-of-year equipment sales combined with inventory that was sold in the divestiture of our Phoenix and Tucson Arizona locations  which also occurred in our fourth quarter of fiscal     . Strong sales combined with lower inventory levels accelerated our equipment inventory turns to  .  in fiscal      from  .  in the prior year. I will provide a little more color on our inventory on the next slide.,0.01220542099326849,NEUTRAL
Our rental fleet assets at the end of the fourth quarter decreased to    .  million compared to     .  million at the end of fiscal     . In addition to the defleeting earlier in the year  we also sold rental fleet assets as part of our fourth quarter divestiture of the two Arizona construction stores. We anticipate our fleet size to increase slightly by the end of fiscal      to around     million.,0.0020688287913799286,NEUTRAL
As of January           we have     .  million of outstanding floor plan payables on      million of floor plan lines of credit  which leaves us with considerable capacity in our credit lines to handle our equipment financing needs. Our adjusted debt-to-tangible net worth ratio is a strong  .  compared to  .  in the prior year period and is well-below  .   which is the leverage covenant requirement of our two largest floor plan facilities outside our bank syndicate and credit agreement.,0.06586442075786181,NEUTRAL
Turning to slide   . The amount of new and used equipment inventories are reflected in the size of the red and blue bars on the slide. As I mentioned  strong fourth quarter sales combined with the divestiture drove a     .  million decrease in new equipment and a    .  million decrease in used equipment as compared to January           generating the higher equipment turn of  . .,-0.024806072935461998,NEUTRAL
Supply chain disruptions due to the pandemic and strong customer demand particularly in agriculture has created an overall tighter industry supply of equipment. Our equipment orders  level of presales and used equipment inventory have us well-positioned to meet our revenue targets for fiscal year     . Given the lower inventory starting point for the year and the strong end market in ag  we expect our inventory turn will continue to increase throughout fiscal     .,0.019440309144556522,NEUTRAL
The overall quality of our inventory remains very healthy. Our inventory under non-interest bearing terms  which can be seen by the gray bar on the slide ended the year at   .    reflecting a higher mix of International inventory compared to that of the prior year. We have longer non-interest bearing terms available with domestic inventory purchases than we do with purchases in our International business. When procurement levels increase in fiscal       we would expect to see this non-interest bearing percentage rise as well.,0.2310623349621892,POSITIVE
Slide    provides an overview of our operating cash flows for fiscal years      and     . The GAAP reported cash provided by operating activities for fiscal      was      million  compared to    million last year. As part of our adjusted cash flow provided by operating activities  we include all our equipment inventory financing including non-manufacturer floor plan activity and adjust our cash flow to reflect the constant equity in our equipment inventory allowing us to evaluate operating cash flows exclusive of changes in equipment inventory financing decisions.,0.009073163411812857,NEUTRAL
After applying these adjustments  our adjusted cash provided by operating activities was a record     .  million for fiscal year      compared to    .  million in the prior year. Solid bottom-line performance combined with good working capital management  including the reduction of equipment inventory  I just discussed drove this robust cash flow metric.,0.08162869373336434,NEUTRAL
This strong cash generation has allowed us to pay off all of our domestic interest-bearing credit lines and end fiscal year      with cash on the balance sheet of     million. We have never generated this level of cash flow before and our balance sheet has never been stronger.,0.23358166962862015,POSITIVE
On slide     we are introducing our fiscal      full year modeling assumptions. Our business is performing well and we are bullish on our prospects this fiscal year given the improving macro backdrop particularly in ag.

For the Construction segment  our initial assumption is for revenue to decrease in the range of flat to down   . Impacting this assumption is the divestment of our two construction equipment stores in Arizona at the end of fiscal       which accounted for approximately     million of combined revenue.,-0.02400663774460554,NEUTRAL
Excluding these revenues from the prior year base  our assumption results in a same-store sales range of up    to   . This divestiture reduces invested capital and will further strengthen the bottom-line results of our Construction segment.,0.2017374214483425,NEUTRAL
For the International segment  our initial assumption is for revenue growth in the range of up     to    .

Our assumption anticipates transitioning back to a more normal operating environment with some strength anticipated from higher global agriculture commodity prices.,-0.06721239956095815,NEUTRAL
From a diluted earnings per share perspective  we are introducing a fiscal      range of   .   to   .  . This range now  includes all ERP implementation expenses and in addition to normal variable expense increases on higher revenues anticipates expenses rising as we transition to a post-pandemic business environment and incur higher costs in areas like travel  fuel and employee medical expenses.,0.0009090167295653373,NEUTRAL

Regarding tax  we anticipate an effective tax rate for fiscal      of approximately    . We still expect this rate will vary quarter-to-quarter as profit and loss mix fluctuates due to seasonality within our various international tax jurisdictions where corporate tax rates vary and valuation allowances exist.

Thanks  Mark. Good morning. I d like to -- I guess focus on inventory the big reduction. We saw improved turns. You referenced some supply chain challenges. If you could speak to that and when you think inventories will normalize  And I guess the implications for margins right when supplies are tight  do you think that there s more pricing flexibility ,0.42464034259319305,POSITIVE
Bryan Knutson,0.0002706465602386743,NEUTRAL
Sure. Thanks  Rick. This is Bryan. We do have as we mentioned a good inflow of presales coming in a nice amount of late-model used inventory on hand. Lease returns that will be coming back throughout the year as well as our current inventories and then our Q  order book that opens soon here. So we re positioned well. We feel good. Obviously  there are some supply chain disruptions  as you mentioned a lot of them due to COVID  some of them due to the fairly rapid uptick in the commodity prices. But yes  that will potentially help margins as well.,0.3349018511362374,POSITIVE
A lot of the growers are aware of the longer lead times. Of course  the manufacturers are ramping up production.

Rick Nelson,8.921956759877503e-05,NEUTRAL
Great. So equipment margins this quarter were relatively flat with last year. Is it possible to separate  or can you comment on what you re seeing on the new equipment side and the used equipment side ,0.1442968249320984,POSITIVE
Mark Kalvoda,0.002285826572915539,NEUTRAL
Yes  I can take that  Rick. This is Mark. Yes and I think this kind of goes for next year as well. So with the higher level of revenues that we re expecting on the new what happens is that some of these bigger-ticket items the combines the four-wheel drives. So even in a tighter environment those big-ticket items typically don t garner the same level of margins that some of the smaller lower-priced equipment is. So that is a little bit of the lower results for the quarter was on that and some of our expectations for next year.,0.06680235266685486,MIXED
Overall  I think we can improve those equipment margins a little bit  but there s going to be -- because of the tighter environment that you referenced. And particularly on used  some -- should be able to see some nicer margins on used. But from a new standpoint  we ll be somewhat held back because of those higher-ticket items making up a larger mix of what we re selling.,0.014407304115593433,MIXED
Rick Nelson,8.921956759877503e-05,NEUTRAL

Mark Kalvoda,0.002285826572915539,NEUTRAL
Yes. So it s hard to know exactly how that s all going to play out with the timing of the -- with the inventories coming in.

Larry De Maria,0.0002354868920519948,NEUTRAL
Thanks. Good morning everybody. Wanted to start off construction question. I mean  I don t think anybody expects your fiscal     and this calendar      to be huge construction year per se  but still looks a little conservative  given the segments like housing and ag  which you play into look a bit more favorable. So what s holding that back  And I would think we have -- obviously have an easier comp on the energy side too which could potentially be a little bit better. So what s holding back better construction performance at this point ,0.1484469324350357,POSITIVE
David Meyer,0.00014165928587317467,NEUTRAL
Well yes  this is Dave  Larry. I think we are guiding pretty much in line with what we re hearing from the industry. And our targets are the small to midsized construction equipment which is -- tends to -- I think the expectation a little bit higher. But infrastructure builds too. A lot of unknowns in there and the timing of when that could potentially happen with the stuff. So  again  I think we re guiding pretty much in line with the industry and we re optimistic into that segment. But it s a little bit going to be a timing on both the COVID and the oil starting to pick up. There s still a little bit of caution out there and how long is that going to last  And where is all this energy going to go  So  I think in the most part  we re in line and we re optimistic.,0.09299183264374733,NEUTRAL
Larry De Maria,0.0002354868920519948,NEUTRAL
Okay. Thanks. And obviously  we expect to sell out a new ag equipment this year  more so than in a while. Can you talk about the conversations  I know you mentioned  technology upgrades  but we have an old fleet. And when growers are coming in to buy equipment  are they coming in more for the tech upgrades or more because they need to replace older equipment  And also  can you talk about take rates on these higher tech piece of equipment this season versus maybe last season  How much more of that higher tech stuff are they taking this year ,-0.17825735360383987,NEGATIVE
Bryan Knutson,0.0002706465602386743,NEUTRAL
Yes. Thanks  Larry. This is Bryan. It is a mix of tax purchasing  as well as upgrading older equipment to more efficient equipment and then also the technology. So  really a mix of all those technology is a big driver. We re getting higher take rates as you mentioned. Some of the things like the harvest command has become an extremely high take rate  which automatically adjusts the combine for the conditions to optimize the combine.,0.44285988714545965,POSITIVE
Also  our soil command is increasing take rate quite rapidly  adjusting the tillage to make a better seed bin. A lot of the precision planning components have also been a very high take rate and growing as well. And then  steering and precision have a very high take rate as well. So -- and then  the connected machines  the telematics also continues to really ramp up. So there s a lot of drivers on the technology side that we continue to see that ongoing throughout the year.,0.03157690167427063,MIXED
Larry De Maria,0.0002354868920519948,NEUTRAL
So with that in mind -- that s really helpful. Two follow-up questions to that. First is  if you re selling more bigger expensive equipment that has all this extra technology  shouldn t you be able to capture more margin  or is CNH capturing that  And with this telematics and connected machines  how does this going to impact your aftermarket capture rates  That impact mix for the positive over the next few years ,0.06873946264386177,NEUTRAL
Bryan Knutson,0.0002706465602386743,NEUTRAL
Yes. And there are a couple of components to it too  Larry. There s the initial transactional price of it and -- which again is a driver of the purchase right now and then the ongoing revenues associated with it. So  anywhere from annual subscription fees that the farmer pays to get that data  as well as the other things that telematics can do for our parts and service business  allowing us to really help the grower and help the contractor with their uptime and just keep the machine going  preventive maintenance and then helping us to really partner with them and make them more profitable. So there are several additional revenue streams there through the precision and the parts and service side as well for us.,0.14663884043693542,NEUTRAL
Larry De Maria,0.0002354868920519948,NEUTRAL
Okay. But it just seems like CNH is not sharing as much on this higher tech stuff  and keeping more than they re letting you guys do with selling it. I don t know  if that s right or not  but it seems like you should be capturing more margin upfront  if you guys are selling all these higher tech piece of equipment and software upgrades ,-0.39865589421242476,NEGATIVE
Bryan Knutson,0.0002706465602386743,NEUTRAL
Yeah  yeah. I think an opportunity that we re really excited about is the ongoing incremental revenue opportunities  again  through subscriptions and through the additional revenue sources that it provides for us with parts and service will be a couple of examples of that.,0.2924365974031389,POSITIVE

Good morning to everyone. I want to continue with Larry s train of thought here. You re talking about this kind of life cycle opportunity that you have given precision technology and so on being added to the machine. But as you ran your own analysis on this  is there a way for us to understand  how much higher is the opportunity on service and maybe parts and maintenance on these upgraded machines versus equipment that was not smart for lack of a better term  I mean  is it     higher opportunity over the life of the machine  Is it     Is it     How would you describe it ,0.31506258621811867,POSITIVE

Hey  good morning  Mig. We ve got the additional parts and service opportunity. And then as we go forward our Titan tech support teams will continue to offer the tech support services. So I don t have specific numbers for you at this time in terms of will that incrementally drive our parts business     per se or whatever. It is difficult to break down always with that parts purchase  or service purchase  specifically due to the technology or replacement or walk in et cetera. So at the point of sale  we don t specifically break down our purchase   our parts purchases as an example like that.,-0.11101097986102104,NEUTRAL
Mig Dobre,0.4966822395508643,POSITIVE
No  I mean  I understand that. But I would imagine  just like you say right  there s going to be a support revenue stream here associated with this equipment. It s more complex. It s perhaps less user-friendly without the proper support from the dealer. So I think we re all trying to understand as the industry is evolving here  what your part in this ecosystem is and how you re going to be profiting and benefiting from it. I think that all of us are really kind of asking the same question.,-0.31683842837810516,NEGATIVE
Bryan Knutson,0.0002706465602386743,NEUTRAL
Yeah. And frankly  we re probably in the same boat with you there. But we re   we believe it definitely makes the customer stickier to us. We re adding resources to handle the tech support side of it to drive the sales of it. We are optimistic again to what it ll do for our parts and service. It just has been difficult to model out at this point exactly what impact it will have on parts and service as an example for us.,0.12721074000000954,MIXED
Mig Dobre,0.4966822395508643,POSITIVE
Well  when you do have a model out  I think we d love   all love to hear it. Mark a question for you maybe. It s interesting that you re no longer excluding your ERP-related costs. So I m curious as to why you ve made that decision. I m also curious as to what you anticipate these costs are going to be in fiscal      ,0.19297530688345432,NEUTRAL
Mark Kalvoda,0.002285826572915539,NEUTRAL
Yeah. So Mig  we ve been adjusting these ERP transition costs out now for the last two years. And we re close here closing in on the full implementation. So yeah  we just decided to put this in our   not just adjust these out put them into our regular operating costs here. Some of the incremental costs that we re going to be incurring this year as we get close to the go-live is going to be internal resources  to help in the training and support and those type of things. And those are the type of things that we wouldn t be adjusting out anyways or we haven t adjusted out in the past.,-0.08678843639791012,NEUTRAL
Last year  what you can see in our tables there that we did adjust out was a little over -- I think it was a little over    million or about    million or   .  . We d expect that to ramp up a little bit this next year just for the reasons I said and put more internal resources to this again for training support after go-live and going into the go-live that type of thing. So call it another    million    .  million. So roughly around probably   .  million is what we re looking at for like incremental ERP costs over last year is what was in the adjusted numbers.,-0.10704951360821724,MIXED
Mig Dobre,0.4966822395508643,POSITIVE
Okay. All right. Then if I may I want to ask a question on construction. Maybe I missed this  but the two dealerships that you ve divested  it was implied there that this is going to be margin positive with them being gone. Can you give us a sense for what these two dealerships  how much of a drag maybe they were to your fiscal       or the benefit that we could get from margin from just these two being gone in      ,-0.05514859780669212,MIXED
Mark Kalvoda,0.002285826572915539,NEUTRAL
Yes. It gets a little tricky to answer that. I mean  we allocate out SRC or our corporate expenses here to those locations. With allocating those expenses out on those stores did lose like maybe   .  million something like that. But they did absorb some of the corporate costs. So taking that out it wouldn t be that much. But it was overall  like I said  with SRC allocation out there it was about   .  million.,-0.023460639640688896,MIXED
Mig Dobre,0.4966822395508643,POSITIVE
Okay. It kind of begs the question on construction here. We re starting to see some growth. As somebody was pointing out earlier maybe your guidance is conservative in terms of how you re thinking about same-store sales for     . But look the margin in construction is still not probably where you want it to be. Can you remind us what the long-term vision is here  I mean  what are you guys working towards  I m presuming that it s more than  .  . And how do we get there ,-0.017158720642328262,MIXED
David Meyer,0.00014165928587317467,NEUTRAL
Well  so Mig  our strategy here is to really grow that parts and service business around that Construction business. And I think we ve made some really good progress in that area. And also focus on the key products  I mean  when you look at construction you ve got a huge range. You ve got aggregate. You ve got the really heavy mining stuff. You ve got the really large roll building equipment. Then they re more of our target space.,0.32839210703969,POSITIVE
We re targeting the homebuilders  the commercial building  a lot of the subcontractors  your landscape people and stuff like that. So they really focus on that sweet spot where we ve got some  I think  some really solid progress. We ve got heritage legacy. We have backhoes mini-excavators  some of the mid-sized wheel orders to focus on that product.,0.2364821657538414,NEUTRAL
And then as I see as we get into some of our core footprint where we got some of the -- farmers use a lot of ag equipment and the ranchers. All your feed lots  all your seed and chemicals start to come in cold. So you re looking at skid steer loaders all-terrain forklifts land improvement. A lot of our growers have excavators. They re roving racks. They re putting in entire irrigation. So I think it s mini-excavators  loader backhoes  wheel orders for  like I said  for feed lots. But also the ag-related businesses some of your crop inputs companies  some of your ag processing plants are some of the big buyers of construction equipment. So they have to focus that and some of our key areas. So we ve got these synergies of both our people.,0.07578083500266075,NEUTRAL
The Upper Midwest where you ve got the ag. We ve got I think some decent talent. If you look at towns like Des Moines  Omaha  Minneapolis  St. Paul and some of it right in our footprint in the south and we could get some of these synergies with our people with our customers and also that ag-related business. So -- and at the same time you continue to grow this higher-margin product support business. So I say  that s our strategy.,0.1221735067665577,NEUTRAL
Mig Dobre,0.4966822395508643,POSITIVE
Right. I mean  I appreciate that. It s just that we ve been through a couple of cycles here with construction and we are yet to see actual margin momentum out of this business. And we re at the beginning of what probably is going to be a pretty good demand up cycle  right  So just as your   David  as you re thinking strategically about this portion of the business  do you see this business getting to the point where it can be as profitable or close to as profitable as your ag business  or is there something in here that will still hold it back and we should keep our expectations in check ,0.3059460590593517,POSITIVE
David Meyer,0.00014165928587317467,NEUTRAL
No. We definitely have and there s been years where we ve got some of our CE stores have actually been some of our top profitable stores as a percentage. So yes  I think it s definitely  if you look historically  there s been a lot of wealth created in the construction equipment distribution channel out there some creating multimillionaires. So yes  it s definitely a very viable segment.,0.380588018335402,POSITIVE
And like I say it is cyclical. There are some difference between the ag. But I think when we get into some of these common markets and stuff I think it works really well for us. So   but I can say  what we ve done with some of our divestitures we re trying to really focus on in these markets and where we think it s a good environment to be profitable and it s in the right space. And I guess that s why we ve made some of these divestitures to get ourselves in a better position.,0.03948143124580383,NEUTRAL
Mig Dobre,0.4966822395508643,POSITIVE
Right. Well  final question for me. You spent a good amount of time talking about inventory and talking about tightness in the channel. I guess  what I m wondering here is this. If demand is better than what you re anticipating right now in agriculture  so better than up     to      do you think you have the ability to get inventory to satisfy that demand  or are things so tight now that you would simply have to sort of say  Hey look I m going to take the order but I might not be able to deliver the machine until fiscal     .  Can you help me understand that dynamic ,0.17380810528993607,POSITIVE
Bryan Knutson,0.0002706465602386743,NEUTRAL
Yes  hey  Mig. We   as we go throughout the year here that could happen. There s a lot of growers that pre-sold crop last year and are just going to start recognizing these higher prices  as we go throughout the year some of them maybe not until harvest time and so on. But if we got into that opportunity  again we do have a pretty good supply of late-model used.,0.15688135102391243,POSITIVE
We ve got presales that are coming in throughout the year. We ve got some larger customers that we roll with that generate quite a bit of nice late-model used for us. So that also is another good opportunity for us. The lease returns that I mentioned earlier  we ve got quite a few of those coming back  really nice supply of those.,0.44328869925811887,POSITIVE
The new itself could get tight. So if you got into that situation you could see a bit of a change in mix of revenue for us from   to more used but   and then we do have the opportunity to pre-sell into next year as well  which is very common with the lead times that would   and a big uptick like that could end up potentially being captured for us next fiscal year when that equipment would ship in then.,-0.03193146549165249,MIXED
Mig Dobre,0.4966822395508643,POSITIVE
Okay. Just to clarify  because I think I heard you answer another question saying that  you re kind of expecting to be able to kind of catch up from an equipment availability and supply standpoint somewhere around the fourth quarter. But that s using current assumptions for growth and demand. If things are better than that then that s essentially the thing that kind of starts pushing things into fiscal       right  Did I get that right ,-0.028189130127429962,NEUTRAL

Good morning  guys. It s Ryan on for Steve. I want to go at technology a little bit different direction than others have here. But we know there s increasing demand for greater technology in equipment that should boost parts and service accelerate through replacement cycle  et cetera for you guys. But what are you seeing as far as consumer desire for greater digitization of the retail and service experience and your guys  ability to buy  sell  service  do more online  And I guess  what are you guys doing from an investment standpoint  What are your customers pushing for there ,0.12764526158571243,NEUTRAL
Bryan Knutson,0.0002706465602386743,NEUTRAL
Yes  we continue to see a higher adoption rate of that all the time  especially with the younger generation farmers that are starting to come into play. These farms are starting to turnover more and more as we go forward. We ve done a lot with our website working on developing further our customer portal as well as our e-commerce site.,0.21446635713800788,NEUTRAL
So  giving our customers the ability to purchase parts online  schedule service online  we got a number of things built into our new ERP that will go with that when we do the full rollout as well.

David Meyer,0.00014165928587317467,NEUTRAL
Okay. So  first of all on the ag  there s been a little bit of a pause on that. I think the basic fundamental s out there. I think we re on the front edge of another round of consolidation  the aging dealer principals  the sophistication of the equipment  the capital requirements out there  lack of succession alternatives  things like that.,-0.15859787352383137,NEUTRAL
So with COVID  to get this  it s been difficult to get totally engaged. The travel restrictions  people wear masks  a little awkward to go in and out of dealerships. And at the same time and most of the dealerships out there receive PPP loans  and they re in the whole forgiveness process right now.,-0.3384983669966459,NEGATIVE
With that said  we ve got a number of really quality  and I can say large acquisition targets that we re actually working through to the owners and the principals right now. So  I m optimistic about that.,0.39089412800967693,POSITIVE
And again  on Construction  again  we look at the market we don t really disclose exactly locations. But I guess we want that company to be profitable.

But definitely we re engaged. We ve got the balance sheet to do some acquisitions out there  and we re really looking at doing some larger-quality acquisitions  and we re fully engaged with that.

Thank you  Brian. And it s a pleasure to be here with you this morning. I ve got a few slides that accompany my prepared comments this morning. They re going to be shown on this video chat that you can also see them on our investor website next to the webcast for this event. Before we start  I want to remind you that I ll be making some forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risk and uncertainties. So please refer to the UP website and our SEC filings for additional information about our risk factors.,0.21442156011471525,NEUTRAL
So let s begin on Slide  .      presents a fantastic opportunity for Union Pacific to leverage our service and efficiency improvements over the past two years and win in the marketplace. And improving economy only bolsters the opportunities that are best in industry franchise provides. While our business was impacted in February by large scale weather events that doesn t change our long-term optimism  improving GDP and industrial production forecasts as well as continued strength in consumer spending and housing starts builds confidence in a strengthening economy. The recent signing of the COVID relief package should further boost that recover. And while rising fuel prices are impacting our expenses  there could ultimately be a positive trade off when you consider truck competition.,0.2935343636199832,POSITIVE
Turning to Slide    February was a challenging month for our network. Heavy snow in the Pacific Northwest  snow and Arctic temperatures across the Midwest and snow and ice across Texas  Arkansas and Louisiana had significant impact on our operations and that of our customers. The South in particular is not accustomed to the weather they ve faced. This picture on Slide   that shows our Houston s Englewood Yard covered in snow is still very difficult for us to fathom.,-0.28286274522542953,NEGATIVE
But thankfully  our network has recovered quickly and we re able to mitigate the impact to our service. As the chart on the slide demonstrates our freight car velocity is rebounding and we are currently running in somewhere around     daily miles per car. It s especially encouraging given how quickly we ve also seen our volumes recover with current seven-day carloadings running a bit over         seven-day. Our entire operating department should be commended for the excellent work they perform in navigating this situation. The operational transformation that we ve achieved through Precision Scheduled Railroading was demonstrated again in our network resiliency.,0.36990363569930196,POSITIVE
Turning to Slide    with a couple of weeks left in the quarter  first quarter volumes are down    overall. We ve made up some ground over the last couple of weeks and the trajectory of our volumes is positive. Our premium business is up    in the quarter  driven by continued strength in intermodal due to e-commerce and restocking. And the typical March volume drop from the Lunar New Year has been muted compared to prior years. Business wins in the area helped fuel the strength as well. However  within our premium line  automotive continues to be challenged by the impact of the semiconductor chip shortage.,0.1174961980432272,NEUTRAL
Our expectation is that production will be recovered through the course of the year. While our both businesses down    reflecting the impact of the weather event  strength in export grain remains. Grain and grain products is up      but coal being down     offsets that growth. Even prior to this storm impact  our industrial volumes were down year-over-year as a result of energy-related declines. Strengthened forced products driven by that strong housing market remains an area of growth in the quarter.,-0.1325584752485156,NEUTRAL
The impact from Texas storm continues to affect our industrial  chemicals and plastics business  as the majority of the overall top line impact from the event lies within that business group. We re working with those customers to support their recovery and are ready to serve them.,0.021306026726961136,NEUTRAL
Turning to Slide    in early February  we announced that our Science Based Targets reduced greenhouse gas emissions in accordance with the Paris Agreement were approved by SBTi. Our target is to reduce scope   and scope   greenhouse gas emissions by     against the      base by     . This is a very important step for Union Pacific in our sustainability journey.,0.07367069384781644,NEUTRAL
Additionally  for many years now  we ve participated in the carbon disclosure project. We re excited to announce that we received the grade of A- in climate disclosure  demonstrating our leadership in that area. Additionally  we received a supplier engagement rating of A  indicating we re effectively engaging our suppliers on climate change. Union Pacific firmly understands the role we need to play in the fight against climate change and we are committed to being a leader.,0.39251473276817705,POSITIVE
Turning to Slide    we entered the first quarter       recognizing some year-over-year challenges related to business mix and fuel surcharge revenue  but with an expectation to grow volumes. Unfortunately  the weather impact I just discussed  which reflected both our revenue and expenses added another degree of difficult.,-0.11542494036257267,MIXED
Additionally  fuel prices have risen in the quarter  providing an additional headwind. For example  we re currently paying about a   .   a gallon. While our fuel surcharge programs will ultimately cover this increase  we do have about a two month lag. So while our full year guidance is unchanged  the impact of weather and fuel in the first quarter will prevent us from making year-over-year operating ratio improvement  an improving economic outlook  strong volumes across a number of key areas and our expectations for productivity going forward  provide us confidence in the full year.,0.008581411093473434,NEUTRAL
Finally  our Virtual Investor Day will take place on May   with more details to come. We re excited to lay out our strategy to drive long-term value for all of our stakeholders.,0.42462499826797284,POSITIVE

All right. Great. Thank you  Lance  for the rundown there. Just to focus on the short-term for many here  you mentioned ORs not going to improve. In the first quarter  I think you already previously said  that it was   chance is going to deteriorate year-over-year. So was the change from  obviously  what s happening between now last time we spoke  but what was the main change  the weather impact and seeing snow in Houston or were there some other end markets that maybe weren t coming up to speed as what you thought you mentioned coal  but clearly that was going to be challenged from the beginning of the year. So ,0.08155088126659393,POSITIVE
Lance Fritz,0.0029772091656923294,NEUTRAL
Brian  it s entirely about fuel and the weather event. Those two things alone  when you take them out  I think we re going to see underlying strength in the business as we report the first quarter. But January started out very well. February was deeply impacted by the weather event. March looks like it s coming along just fine. And I think we re just going to run out of runway.,0.10435371659696102,MIXED
Brian Ossenbeck,0.00040966452070279047,NEUTRAL
Right. Okay. One thing that we ve all seen obviously as a service challenges through weather. And even before that with a lot of congestion on the West Coast ports. But one thing  I think we haven t really seen is UPs have similar issues as your peer. So why do you think that is and we ve also seen you re putting in some surcharges and maybe some adjustments in terms of the minimum commitment program. So are those to kind of tweak the situation and get through what we ve seen now. Are there more changes to come  How do you keep that fluid when it looks like there s just no end to the container ships off shore ,-0.06822090595960617,NEUTRAL
Lance Fritz,0.0029772091656923294,NEUTRAL
Yes. So let s start with the MCP program and the surcharges. Those surcharges are built around making sure we have boxes available in the EMP and UMAX programs for our committed customers. And we were finding some of those boxes were making their way in an inefficient way away from the MCP customers. So to control that what we do is we put those surcharges on and increase them pretty dramatically to force those boxes back  so we can make sure they go to the committed customers.,-0.11497516557574272,NEUTRAL
So it s been a very strong market late last year and into the early part of this year. Most of those surcharges  if not all of them are off at this point. When it comes to our performance in the West Coast  the rail service product has been sound. Our third quarter difficulties with the snap in e-commerce volumes and parcel volumes  they were pretty much addressed in the fourth quarter or going even into the fourth quarter.,-0.05075736064463854,MIXED
And our service product there was really pretty sound and stayed very good into January prior to the weather event. So what we re trying to do is work with the ports to create much more transparency and visibility across the supply chain and also make sure that we re all speaking to the same KPIs or at least the KPIs that are relevant to getting boxes off the dock into a well and move them.,0.43738325871527195,POSITIVE
There s a lot of transload demand that s happening in the LA basin and to a large degree  that s kind of   except the supply chain. With the international boxes  trying to be put back to Asia as quickly as possible  IPI or international boxes coming inland has really been disrupted  more so than normal. And I think that s kind of screwed up the overall supply chain with an excess demand of domestic boxes.,-0.4407188789919019,NEGATIVE
Brian Ossenbeck,0.00040966452070279047,NEUTRAL
Right. And I think when you look at the other thing we ve seen in the West Coast and Western rail dynamic rather  is this gap in the OR is really just growing. But still we ve seen competition that doesn t seem like a lot of what I mentioned  coal earlier in the year and the contract law state is going to weigh pretty substantially on the whole business. So how do you just keep on doing what you re doing  Is there anything you can do differently in regards to managing through that competition  Is it still going to be a headwind  It feels like we keep talking about this every year  regardless of how big the OR gap gets.,-0.04185022413730621,NEUTRAL
Lance Fritz,0.0029772091656923294,NEUTRAL
Yes. We do have a strong competitor in the West and also we compete aggressively with truck. What we re doing about it is taking our better service product  it s more reliable  it s very consistent and also taking our lower cost structure and competing and making sure we re winning business that can support itself on the railroad. And we re doing that. We see across every single one of our commodity groups  whether it s in the industrial products area  crushed glass or refined product in the bulk area  it can be grain. It s also   we ve won some business in the coal world. And in the premium business  we re seeing a really good bid season right now with beneficial cargo owners and shippers. And we re also seeing some wins in the automotive space. So we re seeing wins be able to come from the better cost basis and our better service product. But we do have a very strong competitor in the West and they re not lying down.,0.290302537381649,POSITIVE
Brian Ossenbeck,0.00040966452070279047,NEUTRAL
Maybe not. One of the other challenges  I think the industry has done a pretty good job so far with is just labor. So with the expectations that things come back  we get through the weather issues. How do you feel about positioning of labor and headcount on the network  It s always challenging to get the volume  right and then to get the right people in the right place for the volume. If you hired a head  do you feel like you ve got more of a buffer  How do you approach that coming out of the coal snap ,-0.3279206082224846,NEGATIVE
Lance Fritz,0.0029772091656923294,NEUTRAL
Yes  we feel like we re in pretty good shape as regards labor  Brian. We haven t run into labor as being a fundamental issue being able to support our service product. We currently still have a fair amount of our employees furloughed somewhere near      just under. And our callback rates to this point have been somewhere between     and low    s. So those numbers tell me that if we need to call back labor  we ve got the ability  we can put them where we need them. But we re also still seeing plenty of productivity opportunities  both in train length in locomotive productivity and how we maintain the railroad. So I anticipate this year  even on the kind of growth we re anticipating  labor is not going to be that big of a deal for us. So I think we re in pretty good shape.,0.15967651084065437,POSITIVE

Okay. One of the other concerns  I guess  just a bigger picture perspective on the operating side is just clearly Jim Vena has been a big change agent and part of getting PSR up and running into the point where you are now performing quite well. So the concern is that some of the operational focus and discipline leaves with them  I m sure the current team would disagree. But maybe you can give us a sense as to what you  Jim and operating team are doing to make sure there s really a seamless transition.,-0.040557049214839935,MIXED
Lance Fritz,0.0029772091656923294,NEUTRAL
Yes. It s a great question. We ve been working on that transition basically since the day showed up  right. Jim  one of the reasons we hired Jim was that he d be a really good catalyst for us  both in pace  in risk-taking appetite and also in perspective than just seeing things that we re old to him that would be new to us. And for the last two  two and a half years  he s done a really good job of helping the team  learn from him  see those things. And you know railroading is a team sport  right. Jim doesn t wake up and make every decision last year for everybody on the railroad. The idea is to help train and help our team  see what needs to be done  make sure we have the metrics in front of us that are the important ones to move and then make the right decisions.,0.45818298938684165,POSITIVE
So what Jim s working on right now with me and for me is more intermodal focused  we ve got a couple of special projects  some terminal projects. I want to make sure he keeps his eye on. But the team that is underneath Eric Gehringer  they re the ones that have been running the railroad for the last couple of years. And they re fully competent. They re very  very good at being able to find productivity  taking risks and making it real. And they re the ones that have been generating the kind of performance we saw all through last year.,0.4961562498938292,POSITIVE
Brian Ossenbeck,0.00040966452070279047,NEUTRAL
It has been pretty substantial performance improvements in a lot of areas setting all time records and we do like the KPIs that you put out there. The one that we continue to  I guess  ask questions on is just on the fuel economy side  I know that mix is the impact of that as well. But when we look at just benchmarking UP versus the peers  there is a gap. It seems like it s been there for maybe a while. So I don t know if it s really going to close or what could get it to close  because it seems like you re already running pretty heavy trains. What else could   what else should we be looking for to close the gap  Because it s a OR story  it s an ESG story as well.,0.19506142009049654,MIXED
Lance Fritz,0.0029772091656923294,NEUTRAL
Yes  you re exactly right. It maybe most important is an ESG story and a climate change support story. Yes. So your point is valid and that is   there is a gap between industry leadership and us. And it used to be mostly about the Canadian railroads and UP and I see CSX has made a real strong move. If you look back to last year  we improved about   percentage points in our C rate. We think there s more of that to come. And there is a structural difference  right. We ve got bigger grades than anybody else in the West and that will impact fuel consumption.,0.3147970661520958,POSITIVE
But we re confident we can be better than what we are right now. And that s mostly about making sure technology continues to take hold in EMS. That s the system that helps an engineer run a train fuel efficiently. We also think there s continued improvement that can be had with train size  so that ll help. And there s continued improvement that can be had as we rebuild the locomotive network  the locomotive fleet  we re not buying new locomotives  but we are still investing in locomotive modernization. And every time we do that  the unit is more reliable and it s more efficient. So there s going to be a little tailwind created by that.,0.34485491551458836,POSITIVE

Got it. Okay. You mentioned intermodal growth  clearly is one of the strong points here and Jim s working on some of this  I guess  wrap up in terms of the specific projects. But we think about intermodal growth at UPs  you said it s historically mixed dilutive or mixes you down  but then it seems like it s starting to change. What are some of the steps you can take to maybe close that gap  Is there any investments or is it really more about getting service consistent and execution to get essentially paid for that ,0.11808042973279953,NEUTRAL
Lance Fritz,0.0029772091656923294,NEUTRAL
Yes  there s really no different magic in the intermodal product than there isn t a carload product. It s all about turning the assets efficiently. And you ve seen us make a fair number of changes over the course of the last year or year and a half  in terms of accessorial charges that are targeted to help our customers know the behaviors that help keep the assets efficient  whether it s chassis or boxes  dwell time on the ramp and behaviors that kind of get in the way.,-0.060076139867305756,NEUTRAL
So it s about getting the box from where it is into a well  as efficiently as we can. That means keeping the ramp time low making dray the driver experience  very good  enter the gate  know where you re going  preferably drop the box off track side  as opposed to put it into storage. And then we can move it over the road efficiently. We ve demonstrated that. Our service products rock solid once you get it over the road. And then once it hits the destination ramp  it s about getting it grounded as quickly as possible and then making sure that we have a home for it on the street somewhere. So it doesn t dwell in the yard.,0.3103583864867687,POSITIVE
One of the things that we re working very hard on is an intermodal train reservation system  an ITR. And it s gaining traction in fits and starts  but at the end of the day  that s not meant to retard future volume in anyway. It s meant to match current capacity with current demand. The better we can do that  the more we can make sure that those assets turn efficiently and reliable  and we need about call it three or four or five-day advanced notice  depending on where the demand is going to be for us to match our capacity with demand. And so we re working really hard to get that mature and to get customers comfortable with it so that they can see participating in a very effective ITR is a self fulfilling prophecy to have a really good sound  reliable service product.,0.15610732045024633,MIXED
Brian Ossenbeck,0.00040966452070279047,NEUTRAL
That s interesting. It brings up the question of just supply chain  connectivity and visibility. I think comments in the past about needing to get that better in intermodal in particular. So is there anything you   any connections  any other things you need from your customers  It sounds like it s probably something that just builds gradually over time. I guess the question is structurally  do you need better visibility  better coordination  that s maybe not there yet. Or is it just something that s already there and you just got to get it turned on and maybe get better acceptance in the market.,-0.11483134329319,MIXED
Lance Fritz,0.0029772091656923294,NEUTRAL
Yes. In our market for the intermodal product  you can imagine there s a spectrum of customers  some are very  very tech savvy and others less  so once you re in our IMC world and deep into the IMC world. So what we re working on is making sure our information and our technology is seamlessly connected with our customer base. Usually  that s through APIs and we re getting more and more buy-in to using APIs to make a greater visibility happen across the supply chain. But it also doesn t have to be that complex  right. It can be as straightforward as making sure we get good participation in an effective ITR part of the bonuses on Union Pacific and making it very easy to deal with.,0.11542447656393051,NEUTRAL
And then rolling out products like we ve rolled out in UPGo  where a DRA driver can show up to a gate on a ramp and know exactly where they need to go with no interaction with humans. It should be ultimately paperless. And so that can create a better environment  a more efficient environment for the DRA community  that s giving us more visibility there as well. And then across the spectrum  making sure that we ve got good visibility at each ramp and that our customers see that and good visibility across the network. Ultimately  what our customers are relying on us for is making sure we get a crossroad  we got good ETAs  we land the product where they need it landed in the ballpark of time where we said it would be  and then we hold them accountable for dragging it off quickly so that they can get to their destination and use the box and the chassis asset license.,0.10114064160734415,NEUTRAL

So I think you also hired a new CIO  I think it was late last year. You can talk about what they re doing  why you brought them in  what their background is and what they bring to the railroad  because clearly it s getting more connected and more digital by the day.,0.141374371945858,NEUTRAL
Lance Fritz,0.0029772091656923294,NEUTRAL
Absolutely. Yes  our new CIO is Rahul Jalali and we hired him early November from Walmart. And what he brings to the table is a deep knowledge base  both in technology  but more importantly from my perspective  the concept of a platform and a technology ecosystem so that our customers can view us from the product platform perspective when it comes to technology. So his experience-based was international  it was transforming the store experience. It was about having to keep those systems up and running at   s reliability  all that translates to us. And what we really benefit from is increased pace of change. He s got a very strong appetite for minimally viable product development.,0.36633812729269266,POSITIVE
So agile is a kind of a way of life for him. We ve been working more and more toward an agile environment. He s just going to accelerate that for us. And then you talk about that product or platform perspective. And what that means is instead of building out big monolithic structures that take a long  long time to develop and are based on precise kind of demands put on us by whoever s buying the product  we re instead working with our customer base  finding what the opportunities are and then very rapidly deploying something that could work and testing it.,0.06791124492883682,NEUTRAL
And then building off of it in concentric rings to ultimately get to a place where you ve got a full blown platform  but instead of waiting and building it out in its entirety and usually getting some part of it wrong  you re advancing it in increments quickly. And if you fail  you get rid of it and you replace it with something that works. And we re already seeing that happen inside the company on things like UP Vision  which is a tool we use in the operating department  and that s now being translated with our customer base as well.,0.0846874862909317,POSITIVE

Great. You mentioned earlier that the truckload competition  being a maybe beneficiary of the current pricing environment. So based on some of the work we ve done UP has probably the biggest opportunity to convert freight off the highway over     miles. What s   how do you look at that market and that potential and kind of gauge the wallet share that you have right now  And maybe what if it could be  Then also  if you can just tell us  why aren t customers converting now as a way to figure out what you need to get them to say  yes  and to remain sticky and not just move with the truckload cycle.,0.02773265540599823,NEUTRAL
Lance Fritz,0.0029772091656923294,NEUTRAL
Yes. That s a great question  Brian. And that is the future  right  Growth is so important for our value creation as we look forward. And we agree completely with you that there s a lot of opportunity out there. We think about it as a share of our customers logistics spend  we call it wallet share. And the baseline that has to happen is we have to have reliable and consistent service  right  Every customer tells us do what you say you re going to do  and I can build around you. And then the second thing we have to do is keep our cost structure low so that we can compete against truck. Truck has some inherent advantages  a lot of route flexibility  but we have inherent advantages and that our cost structure is quite competitive.,0.23166584502905607,NEUTRAL
So for us to win  we ve got a smartly leverage debt cost structure. We ve got to make sure we keep our service product highly reliable and efficient. And then we ve also got to continue to invest in technology and ease of doing business. We ve got a project right now  that s called User Experience for Customer Experience. And what that means is  we re investing a lot of time and attention in making the user experience on Union Pacific systems much easier kind of much more intuitive  much more consumer luck. We think if we do that  we take away some impediments from shippers choosing rail versus truck.,0.20063799992203712,NEUTRAL
Part of it is making sure we re there to educate them on what role we can play. But part of it is helping them not choose a way because they get frustrated because they don t know a stick code for a particular commodity.

That s a good point. In terms of the improving operating ratio and clearly you re focused on growth that s part of the three legged stool you mentioned in prior times  assuming that s not changing. But we tend to think of   the market tends to think of you have   there s a trade-off at some point with growth in OR  and that s probably true to a certain extent  but we look at it that you have additional capacity and as long as you have the discipline to bring it on at the right characteristics to the network then you can probably still do both. So I don t know if that s the right way to look at or one way of looking at it. But how do you look at balancing those two dynamics  which are clearly  what everybody s trying to figure out  like  where does that go right now and how you positioned to move in the future on that curve ,0.23052713414654136,POSITIVE
Lance Fritz,0.0029772091656923294,NEUTRAL
We think you re      right  Brian. We do not think there s a trade-off as we look into the future between growth and operating ratio  we think there s room for both. The way we think it s going to work is exactly as you point out. We do have some excess capacity  both in the network and another assets  whether it s locomotive  some of our freight carved different types. And in that context  we re not going to be silly or kind of stupid about how we bring business on  but to the extent that we bring business on that s got good attractive margin  it fits the network and it fits into how we re running the network  we think is going to be additive. And that gives us a lot of opportunity to create productivity off of that growth  which will allow us an opportunity to continue to improve margin. So we look forward and as we ve guided this year  and we look into future years  we think there s margin improvement at the same time as we re growing. As a matter of fact  we think growth is the way towards some of the next steps in margin.,0.15814348310232162,NEUTRAL

So when you look at the mid-   s that s always the gold standard  the double nickels some of us thought that      might be the year that that could come to fruition  especially after the fourth quarter it was quite strong. I know there s a lot of tailwinds then  and there s some headwinds now  clearly  whether has been a challenge  it s always hard to gauge the full year when you start January  . But when you look at all the moving parts there and was there anything that really held back from making the fourth quarter or recent performance more broadly  the proof point that that is possible  Or was it just too much to get into that early in the year to put your foot down and say  this is the year. How do you think of that  Are these maybe the structure of how we should think of getting to that     at some point ,0.004424769431352615,MIXED
Lance Fritz,0.0029772091656923294,NEUTRAL
Yes. So let me start with our guidance and just reaffirm it because it s a hell of a good year  right  We said the starting points of   .   operating ratio last year  we re going to improve that     basis points or more. We said      million in productivity this year and some growth. I think  mid single digits growth. I can t remember the exact number  but that s a hell of a good year. Now  the fourth quarter was one hell of a good quarter  and it did have a fair number of tailwinds  but at the guts of the quarter  it demonstrated what we re capable of doing when you have decent price  pretty good growth and really sound productivity working together. We think that formula continues to work as we look into the future.,0.19522318989038467,POSITIVE
Now  one thing about this year  it s becoming a little clearer  but at the very beginning of the year  it s pretty damn cloudy is to know exactly what s going to happen in our served markets. Think about what I said at the very beginning  the parcel and e-commerce part of our business is booming and that s about consumer spending money and buying things. But the industrial economy is not  it s still lagging. So there s a disconnect there broadly in the industrial economy  and we need to see the industrial economy start picking it up a little bit for us to feel really  really confident about what s going to happen in      and     . But having said all that  the guidance still stands. And in that guidance  I think it s a hell of a year. And I ll never argue against you  Brian  if you say  you should be able to do more if you grow better than you guided  because I think that s true.,-0.0628490075469017,NEUTRAL
Brian Ossenbeck,0.00040966452070279047,NEUTRAL
Yes. There s expectations and then there s fair expectations. But I understand the point. When you think of the   switching gears for a second into maybe the longer term Positive Train Control has been with the network and with the industry for some time now it s finally in place  interoperability is up and running  I know it was a challenge for UP in prior years to get all those bugs worked out  trains were stopping clearly  not the most efficient thing. Are you at the point where at least you can see some maybe green shoots in terms of getting some benefits  Can you run dynamic blocks too early to think about maybe some positives coming out of this mandate ,-0.08542013168334961,MIXED
Lance Fritz,0.0029772091656923294,NEUTRAL
Yes. Brian  so it is a little too early on dynamic block  but there s a lot of exciting things that the infrastructure that Positive Train Control represents allows us to do. And so just two good examples. The first is I mentioned  EMS  energy management systems on the locomotives. The structure that EMS plugs into ultimately is PTC infrastructure. There s a lot of communication that goes between back office and the locomotive dynamics that are happening on the locomotive. And EMS is feeding back information to the engineer for the engineer to prompt on. And even now it can run an autopilot once the train has started EMS can essentially run the train in cruise control for maximizing fuel consumption. That would not have been  we would not have had nearly the path   the straightforward path we ve had if we hadn t first invested in Positive Train Control.,0.254982978454791,POSITIVE
The second thing that we do is  is kind of both at operating practices and a safety perspective. We ve set up a team of individuals called Operating Practices Command Center here in our Union Pacific center in Omaha. And they can communicate with any train at any time around our network. And what they do is  they use the feedback loops that are fundamentally built off of the PTC  mesh of communication and information  and they monitor trains. And as trains are approaching a particularly difficult territory for that type of train  they ll contact the engineer and ask that the engineer would like a little dialogue about what s coming up and how best to manage the train from a safety as well as an efficiency standpoint. And that would not have been in place  had it not been for all of the PTC spend. And that has huge benefit to us  both in ultimately knocking down things like derailments   human factor derailments  but also that ll be a help when it comes to fuel consumption.,0.06973982509225607,NEUTRAL
Brian Ossenbeck,0.00040966452070279047,NEUTRAL
Right  so that does seem to tie in a little bit into the ESG story from a  the E and the sustainability and the safety side. You mentioned you had a slide on ESG overall. You ve been putting out sustainability reports since I think like     . Clearly it s being more of a focal point for just about everybody. AR has its own white paper out on the topic. But when you look at the business perspective there  I m sure there s some who are allocating some freight awards based on ESG and relative emissions is clearly part of truckload conversion as well. But do you feel like that we re just at the early stages in terms of that being part of the commercial decision  it s at the strategic level  but it s not at the procurement level when it comes to actually making those freight decisions on which mode and with whom ,0.07462922669947147,MIXED
Lance Fritz,0.0029772091656923294,NEUTRAL
Brian  it is starting to show up at the procurement level  mostly in the larger  more sophisticated shippers  I see an ongoing periodic review of big wins that we ve secured. And in the last couple of months  I can tell you there s about four or five  fairly substantial wins that are predicated on us being a help to that customer in their own sustainability goals. And that s becoming a bigger and bigger store  and we emphasize it with every single one of the customers we talked to. Because we can help them  we re not only helping ourselves  we can help them. Last year by choosing to ship on Union Pacific Railroad  our customers saved or avoided    million tons of greenhouse gas emissions  that s a pretty big deal.,0.3040581848472357,POSITIVE

So we only have a couple minutes left here. Maybe just to talk about  you mentioned the stimulus and there s obviously a lot of things coming out of Washington under the new administration. One thing we try to keep an eye on too is just on the regulatory side. So we ve got a new STB Board Chairman  we ve got two new members  it feels like activity is picking up  but maybe not activist is how we would at least characterize it. But there s some big issues in front of them or at least they ve been talking about. So how do you view that at least from the rail perspective and what are your expectations in terms of the ongoing dialogue and looking at some of these issues  which  quite frankly have been around for years ,-0.09378080256283283,NEUTRAL
Lance Fritz,0.0029772091656923294,NEUTRAL
Yes. Well  so we ve had very good relationship with the STB. To this point  we ve maintained those relationships with the existing board members. We re starting to build relationships with the new board members. We think it s critically important that the entire Board understands how the economics of a railroad work and what s important to have happen from their perspective  so that we can continue to attract capital and put it effectively into the railroad. The creation of the STB was all about making sure that railroads had an opportunity to become revenue adequate  attract capital and not face kind of the situation we were facing in the late      s. And it s been a home run. So we constantly are educating the new members about that history and about why it s important.,0.2670727102085948,POSITIVE
They do have a big docket in front of them. I m pretty confident they re going to be prudent in how they work through it. And we ve been proactive as an industry and Union Pacific as a leader in proposing some different things for them to think about as they re facing their docket. One thing that s really pretty damn important is when it comes to thinking about revenue adequacy over the last couple of years  the Board has talked about maybe using that as a measurement  as a yardstick for whether or not there would be any rate control. And we turned that around and said  but that doesn t make sense because we re competing for capital against a broad set of industrials. So we proposed  instead of just looking at the railroads and are you earning your cost of capital  look at our ability to earn against our cost of capital versus all of the competitive environment for investor dollars.,0.12608178332448006,POSITIVE
And if we re way  way out of that box  let s have a conversation. But if we re just competitive in that box  then let us compete. And the data shows  we re basically in the middle of the pack when it comes to that comparison. And in many cases  in comparison to the customers that are complaining to the STB  we re not earning as much against our cost of capital as they are. So I think that s a really good eye opening use of data to help the Board to see the competitive dynamic we re talking about when it comes to trying to attract capital.,-0.005193926393985748,MIXED

But just from like the objectives and the messaging that you re wanting to set out and that we should expect for this sort of event it s not in-person  like  I think you initially wanted  obviously everybody wants  but to show kind of the bench strength of operations.

Lance Fritz,0.0029772091656923294,NEUTRAL
Yes. At the highest level  Brian  what you re going to hear from us is a clear articulation of the strategy going forward that creates value should be very easy to absorb and understand. We know that there s a question mark about hey  what is the bench strength at UP and let s be a little bit more granular about how exactly you re going to continue to find ways to have a reliable  consistent service product  continue to drive precision scheduled  railroading  continue to find productivity. So you ll see us be pretty direct and straightforward about that.

Thank you  Sara  and thank you to everyone joining us today. It s not an understatement to say that      was memorable for everyone. Despite the challenges we face collectively  it s been inspiring to see how innovation in the pharma and biotech industries have persevered to the benefit of society. Although  this is what our industry does day in and day out  I am grateful to see that heroic efforts being universally applauded.,0.49845982604529127,POSITIVE
While that work has rightfully been on the forefront  many diseases don t become front page news  but they do take center stage for the individuals who have been diagnosed. UroGen is focused on developing treatments  focused on urologic and specialty cancers.,0.03116184752434492,NEUTRAL
Last year  our first approved therapy Jelmyto became the first and only FDA approved non-surgical treatment option for adult patients with a low-grade upper tract urothelial cancer. Although  launching Jelmyto in the midst of the COVID-   pandemic certainly presented challenges. We are incredibly pleased with the way our team has responded to those challenges in the first two full quarters of launch. We recorded    million in net product sales for the fourth quarter of      and    .  million since June         launch.,0.40801810947596096,POSITIVE
We continue to be mindful of the environment we re operating in  including the vaccine rollout and its impact on the healthcare system and the patient populations we serve. We have seen these trends have an impact on patient procedures  including Jelmyto uptake in the first two months of     .,0.03451969349407591,NEUTRAL
We continue to closely monitor  and Jeff and Molly will provide more details on our progress shortly. But we remain confident in the outlook for continued and accelerated adoption as the year progresses.,0.26715290173888206,POSITIVE
And the demonstration of what s possible makes us even more enthusiastic for what s to come. We ve made important progress in advancing our pipeline and executing on our near- and long-term growth strategies.,0.3815563253738219,POSITIVE
Most recently  we initiated the ATLAS trial  our Phase   clinical study of our lead product candidate  UGN-     for patients diagnosed with low-grade intermediate risk non-muscle invasive bladder cancer. We re very excited about the UGN-    program for many reasons  but mainly for the significant unmet need in this patient population with no FDA approved primary treatment options.,0.2930054541211575,POSITIVE
We believe that there are important similarities across the therapeutic indications for both Jelmyto and UGN-     and we hope to leverage our learnings and experience from Jelmyto and apply those to UGN-    and its potential for these approximately        patients annually in the U.S. alone. The low-grade intermediate risk patient is a unique patient population  identified as at high risk for recurrence and current standard is just not good enough.,0.06428480660542846,NEUTRAL
In our Phase  b study      of patients had received three or more TURBT surgeries prior to enrolling in the trial. These patients deserve better options and if UGN-    is approved  these patients may benefit from the first primary non-surgical treatment options.,0.0470030524302274,NEUTRAL
We were very encouraged by the data we share from the OPTIMA II trial  showing a strong complete and importantly durable response  and believe it supports   -- UGN-    s potential as an outpatient treatment option for these patients. We intend to present these data at an upcoming medical meeting and published in a peer reviewed journal.,0.34906503654201515,POSITIVE
Our work extends beyond low-grade disease to high-grade disease. Our early-stage programs most notably UGN-     is initially being studied in high-grade non-muscle invasive bladder cancer  a life threatening disease with risk of progression.,0.008409352914895862,NEUTRAL
We believe that UGN-     which is a combination of UGN-     our TLR     agonist and UGN-     the anti-CTLA-  antibody that we licensed for Agenus  combined with our gel technology has the potential to transform this disease and provide an advanced are currently available treatment options.,0.0712926653213799,NEUTRAL
The recently announced three-year research collaboration with the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center is aimed at advancing this combinatorial intravesical immunotherapy for the treatment of high-grade non-muscle invasive bladder cancer with initial focus on UGN-   . We re particularly excited to leverage the collective experience of Dr. James Allison and Dr. Pam Sharma  who have both been instrumental in developing breakthrough therapies with immuno-oncology.,0.40954814926953986,POSITIVE
We continue to expand our focus in immunotherapy research utilizing our proprietary technology with checkpoint inhibitors as reflected in this week s announcement of a non-clinical sponsored research agreement with Johns Hopkins University to explore this combination in Glioblastoma Multiforme or GBM  an aggressive and difficult to treat brain cancer.,0.04485685925465077,NEUTRAL
These two important programs with world renowned academic institutions are part of our ongoing efforts to expand our pipeline and realize the full potential of our proprietary RTGel platform.,0.03896665748470696,NEUTRAL
As we look ahead  we are pleased to announce that we completed a strategic transaction with RTW  providing funding of     million.

During the fourth quarter of       Dr. Surena Matin from MD Anderson presented the final durability data from our Phase   OLYMPUS pivotal trial evaluating Jelmyto in low-grade upper tract urothelial cancer in a virtual podium presentation at the   st Annual Meeting of the Society of Urologic Oncology.,0.007970166214363417,NEUTRAL
We were pleased to see that in both the OLYMPUS intent to treat population and in the sub-population of patients who were deemed to have unresectable disease. At study entry     of patients achieved a complete response with durability of response at    months estimated to be   .   by Kaplan-Meier analysis. Median time to recurrence was not reached. The safety profile in the OLYMPUS data was consistent with previously reported results.,0.32146079931408167,POSITIVE
This was previously a disease where options for patients included multiple endoscopic procedures or the removal of the kidney and ureter  both of which have consequences impacting patient health and quality of life.,-0.06430937396362424,NEUTRAL
These final durability data from OLYMPUS were in line with our expectations and support the use of Jelmyto as a less invasive kidney preserving durable treatment for a low-grade upper tract urothelial carcinoma  which may reduce the need for multiple endoscopy procedures or loss of a kidney.,0.2305508524295874,NEUTRAL
We also have several updates to provide for our UGN-    program since our last quarterly call. The first of which is the final topline data from the OPTIMA II Phase  b trial evaluating UGN-    as primary therapy in patients with low-grade intermediate risk non-muscle invasive bladder cancer that we announced in November.,0.022238725796341896,NEUTRAL
This study shows that     of patients    and     received the UGN-    achieve the complete response three months after the start of therapy. In this subset of patients  duration of response to    months from start of therapy was estimated by Kaplan-Meier analysis to be   .  . The median duration of response was not reached. Treatment with UGN-    was generally well tolerated and the safety profile was consistent with previously reported results  with mostly mild to moderate adverse events that result over time. In the trial  we observed typical symptoms of exposure to mitomycin and no treatment related serious adverse events were reported.,-0.0014306805096566677,NEUTRAL
As was mentioned  we initiated the ATLAS trial our Phase   study of UGN-    in December and are actively enrolling patients. ATLAS is a randomized control global study and will enroll approximately     patients and compare UGN-    plus or minus transurethral resection of bladder tumor or TURBT to TURBT alone  which is standard-of-care and patients diagnosed with low-grade intermediate risk non-muscle invasive bladder cancer.,0.002969688441226026,NEUTRAL
We are following the same enrollment criteria used in our Phase  b OPTIMA II trial and expect to enroll a similar population. Patients will be randomized one to one to either upfront UGN-    treatments or TURBT and at the three month time point  patients will be assessed for response.,0.005041884025558829,NEUTRAL
Patients who have demonstrated a complete response to either UGN-    or TURBT will be monitored quarterly for evidence of recurrence. Patients who have tumor present on evaluation at three months in either arm will undergo TURBT and then under identical monitoring for recurrence.,0.008661089465022087,NEUTRAL
The primary endpoint of the study is disease free survival or recurrence free survival in this disease. And the trial is a time to event analysis designed to evaluate non-inferiority and superiority. We expect the trial to take approximately one year to enroll and to be completed within approximately three years.,-0.0037199854850769043,NEUTRAL
There are no non-surgical primary therapies approved in this patient population  and today  patients are managed by repeated transurethral procedures under general anesthesia with a minority of patients receiving adjutant water-based chemotherapy.,-0.0025500208139419556,NEUTRAL
For published literature  two-thirds of patients have two or more recurrences and approximately one-fourth have five or more recurrences throughout the course of their disease. I see these patients in my practice and with each recurrence comes an additional surgery. Although  the risk of death from disease is relatively modest  the risk of repetitive surgery is real and these risks include unintended hospitalization for bleeding and infection  as well as a recently reported risk of increased mortality following multiple surgeries for non-muscle invasive bladder cancer.,0.002065348206087947,NEUTRAL
It is our belief that the ATLAS trial is designed to effectively demonstrate UGN-    s potential to change the treatment paradigm by providing a useful non-surgical therapeutic alternative to patients so they can avoid the potential comorbidities and complications that come from repeated TURBT. We look forward to providing enrollment updates on this trial later this year.,0.16438403917709365,NEUTRAL
While there are many similarities with Jelmyto and UGN-     both represent important advances in patient care. One important differentiation is the additional ease of administration that we believe UGN-    may offer patients.,0.06678176659625024,NEUTRAL
Given the feedback we ve received from our clinical trials  including the potential for a nurse to administer UGN-   . We are planning a small feasibility study to assess the potential for at-home installation. We are currently in the final planning stages of this study and expect to start sometime this year. We will provide more details as we progress  but believe that potential ease and flexibility of administration could be an important differentiator for patients with this disease.,0.04594814909796696,NEUTRAL
We we re also focused on expanding our immuno-oncology pipeline  specifically UGN-     which is a combinatorial approach  initially being developed for patients with high-grade non-muscle invasive bladder cancer.,0.01782402970275143,NEUTRAL
As Liz mentioned  UGN-    is a combination of UGN-     our TLR     agonist and UGN-    or zalifrelimab and anti-CTLA-  antibody that we have combined with our RTGel technology. There are significant differences between high-grade disease and a low-grade disease that we focus on with Jelmyto and UGN-   .,0.013515968341380358,NEUTRAL
High-grade non-muscle invasive bladder cancer is an aggressive and potentially life threatening malignancy characterized by both a significant risk of recurrence and disease progression to muscle invasive cancer. And we know that some patients with high-grade non-muscle invasive bladder cancer respond to immunotherapy using Bacillus Calmette-Gu rin or BCG. So there is a strong predicate rationale for exploring potentially better immunotherapies for the treatment of this patient population.,0.001554673071950674,NEUTRAL
As we ve shared before  the non-clinical data that the UGN-    program has generated to-date have been very encouraging  as the combination of UGN-    and an anti-CTLA-  antibody resulted in improved survival and decreased tumor size in our murine model.,0.1884171636775136,NEUTRAL
Additionally  we observed changes in immunological markers such as decreased T regulatory cells and a trend toward increased CD  T-reg ratios. It is our belief that the data generated to-date support the potential of a locally applied combinatorial immunotherapy.,0.0058322877157479525,NEUTRAL
We are thrilled to be collaborating with MD Anderson on this novel program  given their expertise in innovative clinical trials and infrastructure. We expect to progress the UGN-    program this year  which includes potential non-clinical studies for UGN-    and the combination of UGN-    and UGN-     as well as clinical studies for UGN-   . We are working closely with MD Anderson on next steps and trial designs and we will continue to share details as they are available.,0.45391890587779926,POSITIVE
The second immuno-oncology program the highlight is an interesting new sponsor research agreement with the Johns Hopkins University where we intend to explore in a preclinical setting the potential of checkpoint inhibitors combined with RTGel in Glioblastoma Multiforme or GBM.,0.2402574231091421,NEUTRAL
This program stems from our focus on expanding our novel RTGel technology in combination with other medicines to provide treatment options for patients in diseases with significant unmet need and where local immune modulation may make a difference.,0.055226634023711085,NEUTRAL
Our focus with this program is GBM  an aggressive malignant brain tumor  with a five-year survival rate of less than   . GBM is difficult to treat and treatment options today are limited and typically include surgery followed by radiation and chemotherapy. It is the most common primary brain tumor with around        cases diagnosed per year.,-0.008356434293091297,NEUTRAL
With this research  we will examine combining our novel RTGel technology with anti-PD-  and anti-CTLA-  antibodies  respectively  to assess the impact on survival in a mouse model of GBM.,0.007630992859049002,NEUTRAL
While early  we continue to investigate the potential of our RTGel platform in immuno-oncology and explore local applications of immunotherapy  both within our laboratory and in working with key academic centers  who may leverage our technology exploring therapeutic options.,0.02969076116278302,NEUTRAL

Thank you  Mark. I m pleased to provide you with an update on our commercial launch of Jelmyto. As Liz mentioned  we achieved    million in net product sales in the fourth quarter of      and    .  million from the start of Jelmyto launch on June  st through the end of     . This represents a great early start to the launch and is a testament to the important work the team is doing and the value that Jelmyto can bring to adult patients with low-grade UTUC.,0.4868852083127422,POSITIVE
The feedback that our team continues to receive from physicians treating their patients with Jelmyto remains extremely positive and we are seeing firsthand the tremendous impact that Jelmyto is making in the lives of patients.,0.4557380723344977,POSITIVE
The most consistent and recurring themes we hear include patients avoiding surgery and achieving a complete response post-treatment  consistent with what we ve observed in our clinical trial. We ve heard from a number of physicians who have treated their first patient with Jelmyto received a promising response and are now working on identifying additional patients.,0.3012035571737215,POSITIVE
In November of       we announced that CMS established a permanent and product specific J-Code for Jelmyto  which took effect on January  st of this year. The J-Code replaces the previously issued and temporary C-Code  and standardizes and facilitates reimbursement in the hospital outpatient  ambulatory surgery center and physician office settings of care. This J-Code is helpful in simplifying and streamlining reimbursement for physicians and we believe it will translate into improved access to Jelmyto throughout     .,0.1447643948631594,NEUTRAL
There are a couple data points I ve been sharing on our calls to help illustrate the success of the launch to-date and the growth that we ve seen early on. The first is activated site. As of March  st  we have increased our activated sites over     sites up from     sites at the year end and     sites as of November        .,0.08740323825622909,NEUTRAL
These are sites who have treated patients or are ready to treat patients. We expect this number to continue to grow as our sales force    reps continue to target hospital and community accounts  where most of the patients are treated.,0.03157752752304077,NEUTRAL
The other data point that is important to note is repeat accounts or accounts that have treated more than one patient. As it suggested the physicians are seeing clinical efficacy of the drug  the reimbursements working and all of the other components of the process have gone well.,-0.01023130863904953,NEUTRAL
As of March  st  we have increased that number to    accounts  up from    accounts at year end and    as of November  st. This is a critical factor demonstrating that the processes and support in place are working  and clinicians are identifying additional patients and gaining comfort in using this treatment.,0.14168666023761034,NEUTRAL
As we continue to expand usage of Jelmyto and reach additional target providers and accounts  we expect this number to become less relevant  but believe it s valuable in the early stages of launch.,0.019399017095565796,NEUTRAL
We have also received compelling market research results showing the increased level of Jelmyto awareness  a testament to the team s efforts. As of November       aided awareness increased to      up from approximately     pre-launch. We also see a slight shift towards physicians viewing radical nephroureterectomy as less favorable than prior to Jelmyto s approval and we expect to see that increase.,0.3545240497915074,POSITIVE
I d like to take a moment to highlight what we re seeing in the industry today and the impact of COVID-  . We saw that in      cancer diagnoses were down about     and for my own market research  it s evidence that at least one-third of the patients are delaying treatment due to the pandemic.,-0.0938849225640297,NEUTRAL
These phenomena are industry-wide and in January       based on the IQVIA data collected procedures were down    . We are not immune to these trends and are also seeing patients with low-grade tumors deferring treatment.,-0.06714082043617964,NEUTRAL
While we re optimistic for the future  January was the harshest month as it relates to COVID deaths in the U.S. and we want to share two potential trends that are important to know as the pandemic continues to evolve.,-0.004414021503180265,MIXED
Given the patient population with low-grade UTUC is generally in their   s and make up the majority of patients being vaccinated in the early rollout. These patients have prioritize and we expect near-term will continue to prioritize receiving the vaccine before seeking treatment.,0.010487994353752583,NEUTRAL
Additionally  at the hospital level  we are aware that some formulary reviews are being delayed because of the vaccine rollout as the hospitals are focused on prioritizing vaccine. These trends are resulting in a softer first quarter of      than previously anticipated.,-0.06747378408908844,NEUTRAL
That being said  we are seeing leading indicators of potentially new patient starts in the coming months and all metrics reflect high physician and patient interest in adopting Jelmyto into their practice.,0.03949803957948461,NEUTRAL
Based on the recent interactions I ve had in the field with physicians  I continue to hear that physicians are supportive of Jelmyto and its potential benefit to patients. We are closely monitoring this environment as a pandemic and vaccination rollout continues. But anticipate improvement in patient access to treatment providers and to Jelmyto in the coming months  as patients and physicians are vaccinated. We will continue to monitor and adapt to ensure patients have access to Jelmyto.,0.1325654432439478,NEUTRAL
Although we are navigating the unchartered territory of this pandemic  our team continues to deliver and I would be remiss if I didn t thank our team  as well as the many external parties involved  including our partners and our healthcare providers for their continued efforts and commitment to patients.,0.09155303379520774,MIXED

Excellent. Good morning and thanks for taking the questions and really appreciate all the progress through a pretty difficult year last year. Great  so I guess maybe is to start things off  in terms of  Jeff  for the repeat customers that you saw in terms of the accounts. I guess I m just wondering if there s any trends that you see there  categorically is that more tend to be academic centers  community centers is -- what s your expectations there or kind of what you re seeing  first of all  And then secondly  with respect to the first quarter revenue numbers  I guess  I just want to fully understand the expected dynamics to the net revenues. I think  Molly  you said that there were some weather related shipment delays and then there was also  perhaps  some larger orders in the fourth quarter. And then  perhaps there s also something to be understood with respect to the payer environment  payment plan resets or anything like that  I guess  just maybe help us better understand the expected dynamics for the first quarter revenue numbers  And I think maybe that s it for now and I might have a follow-up.,0.39463923685252666,POSITIVE

And to address your first question that  the multiple or the patients or the physicians that have multiple patients  it s primarily probably     to     are those in the hospital. But we do have community accounts that have multiple physicians writing Jelmyto for their patients or single physicians that have identified more than one patient as well.,0.23101090406998992,NEUTRAL

Hi  Chris. To answer your question on the Q  revenues  so as Jeff and I both alluded to  we started to see some softness as we went into January and February this year. A lot of the reasons we discussed in our narrative around the vaccine rollout and some other impacts as it relates to weather. To that effect  we re starting to see the rebound of that.,0.1008784743025899,NEUTRAL
And I think when we look at the patient population that we serve  it was the same patient population that was getting the vaccination or in the queue to get vaccinated.

And then  maybe  lastly  as it relates to some of the stocking charges we saw last year  I referenced about a          to          estimate based upon some indication we got from certain practices that they were looking to stock and or get ahead of any shipment concerns. Remember  last year s holiday season  there was a lot of delays in shipments. So we saw some of that in advance buying last year and we re not going to see a similar pattern.

So with regards to the J-Code  I -- what we ve seen particularly in the community  the community  whether it s warranted or not  tends to be a little bit -- have a little bit more anxiety in around miscellaneous code and so they liked having the J-Code the product specific code. They re being trained with the CMS. CMS has give them guidance on how to build correctly for the drugs.

And so we just  I think  this hopefully answers that question.

We haven t really  maintenance has been something that is in the -- it s at physician discussion.

Hi. Good morning and let me add my congratulations to the progress. Just wanted to dig in a little bit to kind of the dynamics of patients receiving treatment that you re seeing  I guess  given the pandemic and patients not seeing the doctors as you and diagnoses going down. Are you seeing some sort of a backlog of patients  given this backdrop and do you think these patients have been did by practices and are just awaiting therapy that you ll start to see them roll in to receiving the treatment sometime this year ,0.33669766318053007,POSITIVE
Liz Barrett,0.0005430274177342653,NEUTRAL
Yeah. Hi  Matt. It s Liz. Thanks for the question. I am going to ask Jeff to comment. But before  he does  I think  we would speculate  right  that even in the beginning of our launch  there were some patients that had not come in as you saw COVID cases go down somewhat we did and Jeff did nice work on understanding the dynamics of COVID versus our patients.,0.42116638680454344,POSITIVE
And you can clearly see that when diagnosis of COVID went down  patients went up. So we do think that even in the first six months of the launch  were likely patients that had been kind of waiting.

Jeff Bova,-0.0015948357759043574,NEUTRAL
Sure. Thanks  Matt. And I guess to easily answer the question  it depends on the where in the country you are  how bad the cases have been  when did they put into place that they put in a delay in elective procedures. I will say majority that had put in electric procedures are on hold. I have now open elective procedures up. And to your point  Matt  they do begin then to prioritize these patients.

And I think that s probably about what we ve shared along with the fact that we know that in the control arm  we expect recurrence rates to be approximately     or higher at a year  we ve been pretty conservative about our design. So I hope that s helpful in terms of thinking about the trial. But the primary endpoint is recurrence free survival. And Liz may want to comment further on this as well.,0.11584359034895897,NEUTRAL
Liz Barrett,0.0005430274177342653,NEUTRAL
No. I think that s right. I think the powering to your point -- to your question  Matt. As Mark said  we used around a      knowing that  in the literature  anywhere from     to     of those patients will recur if they only have a TURBT and are -- meet the criteria for intermediate risk  and obviously  we used our own Phase   data for the assumptions  but on a conservative side for us as well.

Hi. Good morning  team  and let me add my congratulations on the progress as well. I want to maybe just revisit ATLAS  if we could  and just with regard to your comments with regard to patients being treated at home. I guess my question is twofold here first. Do you see this as potentially for this low-grade intermediate risk population as a potential real world treatment paradigm versus being treated in the clinic or in the hospital  And then secondly  if it would be -- if there is potential for at home treatment model here  how does that potentially affect the economics of UGN-    or just like a function of the environment we re in currently ,0.19151087570935488,NEUTRAL
Liz Barrett,0.0005430274177342653,NEUTRAL
Yeah. Thanks  Paul. How are you  The -- I think  from our perspective  we want to make things as easy as possible on patients. You start to think about TURBT. I think one of the missed information  misunderstanding is that  people think of TURBT  no big deal. As we share     of the patients in our study had three or more TURBT  the patient population we re talking about.,0.14640542306005955,NEUTRAL
And as they have more and more we know it s an independent factor of mortality. So  we re saying how one can we differentiate our therapy from what s there today  which  frankly  doesn t work. And we do know that more and more  this is an elderly patient population. So it s just one additional way.,0.029345739632844925,NEUTRAL
We still think that  frankly  the majority of the patients will go in to the clinic to get treated. But having an opportunity to treat these patients at home  I think will be a benefit to some of those patients who are unwilling or unable to get to the doctor  make it easier on them.,0.10109634697437286,NEUTRAL
I don t think it will impact the financials at all  because obviously  you would get treated at home. They -- it would be through a home health company. So I guess the difference is for physicians  obviously  they would make more money if the patient comes into the office  but the -- again ability to offer that to patients and have that as an option  we think is important. So the financials for us don t really change the financials for the office  obviously  would if the patient came into their office  they would see the revenue associated with that.,-0.11008596420288086,NEUTRAL
Paul Choi,-0.0004796486027771607,NEUTRAL
Okay. Thank you for that concept  Liz. And then maybe as a follow up either for you or for Jeff  just with regard to your comments on the trends you re seeing so far in the first quarter here. Can you maybe just help us conceptualize in your view is this more specific to this quarter  given the various factors such as COVID that you mentioned here or with regard to historical practice and in this population on the commercial side  Is this more reflective you think of typical seasonality in the Medicare population and doughnut holes and put those kinds of factors  Any clarity on that point would be great ,0.3341015721671283,POSITIVE

We -- the good thing is the majority accounts that we re -- that we had out there are the accounts that we re pushing off formulary view are now reviewing.

  comment about the trends. We don t think that it will continue that way. As a matter of fact  as Molly mentioned  we ve already seen it start rebounding in March. So  it made sense that these patients and the physicians  one  now that the vaccines available  wait a few weeks  get the vaccine.,-0.09976484999060631,NEUTRAL

Unidentified Analyst,-0.020186680369079113,NEUTRAL
Good morning. This is Mark  ph  speaking on behalf of Ram. Thanks for taking our questions. I have a couple of COVID impact questions and then two follow-up. First on the Jelmyto sales effort being conductive in the context of COVID-    do you anticipate being able to conduct same promotional activities in the coming months that you weren t able to perform previously  And because the COVID-   pandemic is progressing  ph  down and then in terms of the ATLAS trial enrollment  you mentioned  you expect to provide enrollment update there  I mean -- but I mean  do you see any logistical challenge in execution of the trial due to COVID-   and if so  what are they using  how are you mitigating that  Thanks.,0.08701934665441513,NEUTRAL
Liz Barrett,0.0005430274177342653,NEUTRAL
Yeah. I ll comment about the study. I would say  not really  we anticipated that there would likely be delay  so our expectations for enrollment. We re obviously -- from an amount of enrollment  obviously  it starts slow anyway.,-0.12187346443533897,NEUTRAL
We did make sure that we sort of around the world doing the study. There were a couple of countries that  that delay started the study  but then there were other countries that didn t. And so we ll continue to work through that.,0.12699482776224613,NEUTRAL
But we felt like we have enough sites and is one of the reasons that we actually increase the number of sites versus our initial expectation  because we wanted to make sure that with COVID  if a country or area shutdown  that we would be able to sort of makeup that enrollment elsewhere. So  and then  Jeff  do you want to comment on promotion ,-0.11262715514749289,NEUTRAL
Jeff Bova,-0.0015948357759043574,NEUTRAL
Sure. So what we ve seen is an increase in face-to-face interactions. I was fortunate to get out with some accounts last week  a couple weeks ago and the face-to-face is improving. So they re opening up to face-to-face interactions. And more importantly  they open up to have representatives come in and do presentations over lunch. So a lot of places that have limited lunches or face-to-face interaction are slowly beginning to open those interactions up.,0.23457448929548264,POSITIVE
Where that s still limited  we continue. The field does an excellent job of continuing to have virtual reminders  virtual presentations with the physicians  being mindful and respectful of what the office prefers at this time. But I am happy to say that  yes  there s more face-to-face that are taking place  I can -- I see that continuing as COVID cases go down.,0.1837047068402171,MIXED
Unidentified Analyst,-0.020186680369079113,NEUTRAL
Okay. Excellent. And do you expect the difference between the number of sites activated and the number of sites they have treated more than one patient with Jelmyto to narrow substantially over the course of the next several quarters  And if not  why do you think that  why not ,0.23263556882739067,POSITIVE
Jeff Bova,-0.0015948357759043574,NEUTRAL
No. I expect both to grow. I mean  I think  someone asked a question to  the -- we want all of our sites activated  treating more than one patient. I mean  we want to get to the point where physicians are opening it up. We ve had that too. You have initially you obviously have a champion in the office. But they ask and the goal of the reps -- representatives are to go in and open it up to the other physician. So you have it.,-0.07542330399155617,NEUTRAL
So I expect both numbers to continue to grow as we ve got a large number of accounts that either putting it on formulary  have it on formulary  looking for a patient and then once they experience using Jelmyto with the patient  either finding more patients or certainly that that peer-to-peer influence that I talked about  discussing it with other physicians during their  all of these accounts have tumor boards or medical meetings with their urologist. Making sure that we re part of that agenda is a key goal for us to get the majority of the urologists within an account considering Jelmyto for their patients.,-0.014546740800142288,NEUTRAL
Unidentified Analyst,-0.020186680369079113,NEUTRAL
Okay. Great. And then just the final two housekeeping questions. So  are there any timeframe restrictions on the funding received from RTW investments  So  in other words  does RTW have right to impose additional conditions or require additional consideration of the      million amounts not paid back within a specific period of time  And will are these additional commissions if any  so if funding from RTW secured by any of UroGen s IP tax ,0.017846670001745224,NEUTRAL

Yes. Maybe -- yeah. Sure. To answer that there s no timeframe commitment in the event that      million is achieved over certain period time. So that there s no -- to answer that question  there s no time commitment. As far as collateral  certainly  they have a security main interest on the strip of Jelmyto. And then that s carved out within the IP interest as well  but certainly nothing that we believe would prohibit us to look at ex-U.S. or other BB tech activities in these products.,-0.2873441958799958,NEGATIVE

For the year  we grew   .   materially outpacing category growth of  .  .,0.12605207349406555,NEUTRAL
Turning to the growth drivers in the quarter  we grew sales in five of our six key sub -- salty subcategories including tortilla chips led by the ON THE BORDER brand where sales grew over      more than tripling the subcategory growth of   . From a share perspective  we gained share across potato chips  tortilla chips and Pork Rinds in the quarter  which are more than     of our retail sales. In potato chips  we drove double-digit growth  which was nearly double the category as we continue to increase distribution of our flagship Utz brand outside of our core regions and Zapp s remained on its double-digit growth trajectory. Tangential to the salty subcategories  we also grew our Salsa and Queso subcategories by     and     respectively in Q        and we expect strong continued growth from these subcategories going forward.,0.0803463882766664,NEUTRAL
Moving to our brand portfolio groupings. Retail sales for our power brands grew over     for the quarter  significantly outpacing the category at  .  . For the fiscal year  we grew power brands by      almost twice the category s growth rate and our Foundation Brands grew  .  .

To that end  in       we eliminated approximately    Foundation SKUs totaling nearly     million in run rate sales.,0.010700831189751625,NEUTRAL
Looking ahead to      and beyond  focusing our marketing and innovation efforts around our power brands remains a critical focus for our company.

We are leveraging Boulder s strong Better-for-You credentials and have early launches in place for innovation to include protein puffs amongst others.,0.26242073261528276,POSITIVE
We expect momentum to continue in       as these brands continue to gain traction and we are planning to introduce more innovation to continue to grow the base business.      was a transformative year for us in many respects  but in particular  introducing our brand portfolio to new buyers. In       we saw significant growth in households buying our product  with higher dollars per buyer being spent and increasing rates of repurchase. We grew buyers by more than three million for the    weeks  ending December          versus the prior year  which is nearly two times more than any other salty snack competitor during this period.,0.12542265001684427,NEUTRAL
Moreover  our rates of repurchase increased year-over-year to      suggesting stickiness for this increase in the number of households. We ve seen the total number of buyers growing throughout      and coupled with increasing repeat rates  we continue to gain confidence about what this means for the company s long-term growth prospects. Importantly  this growth in buyers was diversified across age and income demographics  as well as geographies.,0.06882398307789117,NEUTRAL
From a channel perspective  grocery  mass and club continued to drive our retail sales growth. In addition  consistent with our strategy of expanding and underpenetrated channels  we gained share in convenience  where we are currently underweight  notwithstanding overall COVID-related softness in this channel  as well as in our largest channel grocery  which showed strong growth throughout COVID.

For the year  we grew core  expansion and emerging          and     respectively. We are number two in our core  but we are only number four and number five in expansion and emerging markets  signaling continued opportunity to grow our sales. This significant growth and expansion in emerging is particularly exciting  given they now only comprise     of our total retail sales and that includes the impact of the On-The-Border acquisition.,0.2827286509273108,POSITIVE
We continue to benefit from the geographic expansion efforts that have been underway at us for decades. Our acquisitions have helped fuel this expansion and our ability to leverage the footprint gained by our acquisitions to create incremental growth for our power brands has proven to be a very effective strategy.,0.22431123360001948,NEUTRAL
Importantly  while we have been successful in driving above category growth in both emerging and expansion regions  our sales within each represent less than    of the overall category sales and this is less than the    in our core market. This reinforces our belief in the distribution runway we have for the future.,0.2342097083455883,NEUTRAL
Turning to e-commerce  this channel continues to be an area of hyper growth for our company.

Thank you  Dylan and good morning everyone. As Dylan mentioned earlier  in the quarter  we delivered strong topline and bottom-line growth that was in line with our expectations. Net sales increased   .   to     .  million. Gross profit increased   .   to    .  million and adjusted EBITDA more than doubled to     million.,0.4397674530337099,POSITIVE
As you know calendar      was a   -week year and adjusting for the impact of the extra week and the impact of acquisitions  pro forma net sales on a comparable   -week basis increased  .   in the quarter. For the full year  pro forma net sales increased   .   and adjusted EBITDA grew   .   with margins expanding over     basis points to   .   of sales.,0.005065951496362686,NEUTRAL
These results are a reflection of the team s consistency of execution as we delivered category-leading sales growth and margin expansion amidst the challenges of COVID-    going public  and three strategic acquisitions. This speaks to the relentless spirit and culture of the Utz organization and our unwavering focus on delivering for our customers and our shareholders.,0.05439708118501585,NEUTRAL
Moving to the details  our net sales growth in the quarter was driven by volume of  .    price mix of     the extra week of  .    and acquisitions of   .    partially offset by the impact of higher discounts to independent operators  which reduced the net sales growth rate by  .  .,0.008864262490533292,NEUTRAL
As a reminder  we are in the process of converting company-owned DSD routes to independent operator routes. And as we make these conversions  we no longer incur certain selling costs such as route commission compensation  benefits  and transportation cost  but instead we pay a sales discount to independent operators. This has the effect of decreasing net sales and gross profit  but we believe it results in higher EBITDA and margins over the long-term.,-0.09718456119298935,NEUTRAL
Moving down the P L  we had a very strong margin performance in the quarter. Our growth in adjusted gross profit margin of approximately     basis points led to an increase in our adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately     basis points to   .  . As a reminder  prior year margins were impacted by the timing of certain selling expenses that we don t expect to recur and drove a portion of the expansion year-over-year.,0.05452312249690294,NEUTRAL
Dissecting the increase in adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter a bit  volume contributed approximately     basis points of margin growth as we leveraged higher volumes in our manufacturing facilities. Price mix contributed approximately    basis points of margin growth. Acquisitions contributed approximately     basis points of margin growth. Cost of goods sold contributed approximately    basis points of growth as we experienced lower commodity costs due to strong proactive supply chain execution  which locked in favorable contracts that benefited our      results.,0.007949476421345025,NEUTRAL
The   rd week drove approximately     basis points in margin expansion. And finally  selling and admin expense was relatively margin-neutral in the quarter as we had higher incentive compensation due to strong performance and higher marketing and e-commerce spend both offset by lower selling expenses and synergy realization. For the year  selling and admin expense was higher due to the full year impact of higher incentive compensation and marketing and e-commerce spend.,-0.17333983816206455,NEUTRAL
Moving to our balance sheet and other key points. As of fiscal year-end  our liquidity remains strong and we had a cash balance of     million in availability on our ABL credit facility of approximately      million. After year-end and as we previously announced on January   th  we completed a term loan refinancing and placed a new      million term loan B.,0.10069581275456585,NEUTRAL
This new term loan coupled with exercising the public warrants which brought in approximately      million in cash  enabled us to repay in full the      million bridge credit facility used to fund the acquisition of Truco Enterprises and the ON THE BORDER brand and refinance the pre-existing      million term loan B due     .,0.019783610390732065,NEUTRAL
Importantly  this refinancing lowered our expected cash interest cost by over    million annually  lengthened our maturity profile by over three years to      and provides our business with additional financial flexibility to support our continued long-term growth.,0.22218355804216117,NEUTRAL
Pro forma for this financing and the Truco acquisition  our net debt at fiscal year-end      was approximately      million or  .  times normalized further adjusted EBITDA of      million which assumes Truco and H.K.

Before I discuss our outlook for       I d like to provide an update on two strategic projects that will improve our infrastructure and help enable our platform to continue scaling.,0.0017686996143311262,NEUTRAL
First is our ERP implementation. We have completed the phase deployment across our network and our final modules were stood up in February of     . This has been a two-year process for the business and we are excited to begin taking advantage of the incremental analytics and efficiency that a single integrated current state ERP system can deliver. We will also benefit from key employees across functional areas of the business returning from focus on the ERP to helping drive day-to-day execution.,0.27329235438082833,POSITIVE
Second  after a brief pause last year to accommodate the COVID-   impact and the ERP implementation  we resumed our conversion from company-owned routes to independent operators and we expect to finish the conversion in the first half of     .,0.007579118944704533,NEUTRAL
As we ve spoken to before  we believe the IO conversion strategy is incremental to long-term organic growth  is accretive to EBITDA margins and cash flow and helps derisk our business overall. We look forward to completing this initiative which has been ongoing for several years now and we ll also continue to look for opportunities to increase our IO route count by adding new organic routes over time.,0.16216504920157604,NEUTRAL
Turning to guidance. We are looking forward to another strong year for us with our momentum continuing into     . We expect full year      net sales to be consistent with      pro forma net sales of   .   billion.,0.43816327425884083,POSITIVE
For clarity  our      pro forma net sales is on a   -week comparison basis assumes we owned H.K Anderson and Truco on the first day of fiscal      and assumes     million of net sales for Vintners to align with expectations for fiscal       which will have    months of results and be impacted by SKU rationalization activity.,0.01775809098035097,NEUTRAL
Importantly  we expect modest organic sales growth year-over-year even as we lap fiscal     organic growth of over   . As expected due to the COVID-   impact on at-home consumption in      our      pro forma net sales guidance is below our long-term growth algorithm. But importantly  on a two-year stack basis  this results in pro forma sales growth of about    well above our long-term algorithm of    to     which remains firmly intact.,0.06501358491368592,NEUTRAL
We began the year with good momentum  with strong retail sales growth through February and we expect full year      organic growth led by incremental distribution  innovation and price mix  partially offset by the COVID-  -related lap and our continued DSD route conversion to independent operators.,0.2715573734603822,POSITIVE
Moving to adjusted EBITDA. We expect a range of      million to      million versus       further adjusted EBITDA of      million  delivering a margin of approximately    . Included in our      assumptions is the contribution of     million to     million from our acquisitions of H.K. Anderson  Truco and Vitner s  excluded from these numbers are run rate cost synergies from acquisitions of at least    million.,0.0016880391631275415,NEUTRAL
We expect to accomplish the actions to pull through most of these cost synergies by the end of the second quarter of       which is within the range of    to    months we typically have experienced over our acquisition history.,0.006334155797958374,NEUTRAL
Included in our EBITDA assumption is commodity inflation of about    and we are focused on pricing to offset this cost pressure. Additionally  we expect to increase productivity from    to    of cost of goods sold  which helps to offset inflation and fund incremental marketing spend.,0.011444031726568937,NEUTRAL
Finally  and as I mentioned earlier  we are in the process of converting routes from company-owned to independent operator and this conversion increases the rate of growth for sales discounts  which negatively impacts net sales and gross profit.,0.05753275938332081,NEUTRAL
For adjusted EPS  we expect a range of   .   to   .    which assumes fully diluted shares on an as converted basis of      million and exclude step-up depreciation and amortization and stock compensation expense.,-0.06706267967820168,NEUTRAL
Lastly  a few additional assumptions for consideration. First  we funded the     million Vitner s acquisition in February      with balance sheet cash. We are expecting     to     independent operator route conversions in     .,-0.028523456305265427,NEUTRAL
We expect core D A of     million to     million and step-up D A of     million to     million  which are both comprised of approximately two-thirds cost of goods sold and one-third selling and administrative expense.,-0.03961642552167177,NEUTRAL
We expect capital expenditures of     million to     million  as we look to invest behind our productivity program and lean into      targets. We expect cash interest expense of approximately     million. We expect an effective cash tax rate of     to      which is the percentage of pre-tax book income we expect to manifest into cash tax payments. And we expect to end the year with a net leverage ratio of approximately  .  times. That includes unrealized cost synergies of approximately    million from acquisitions.,-0.0005067011807113886,NEUTRAL
Diving into our productivity assumptions  included in our outlook for       incremental productivity efforts are cornerstone of driving higher margins and we expect meaningful progress towards our      goal of    to    productivity of cost of goods sold.,0.013175093219615519,NEUTRAL

Also included in our      outlook is an assumption for increased investments in marketing and innovation. In       we expect a significantly higher mix of digital and e-commerce spending and a lower mix of sponsorship spending and we expect to increase our working digital and e-commerce media spend by approximately     relative to      levels and over      relative to      levels.,0.00027029914781451225,NEUTRAL

From an innovation perspective  we have an exciting slate of new products in fiscal      across brands and subcategories. To touch on a few  first  we are introducing twister s flavored pretzels.,0.1813890552148223,NEUTRAL

Our rich history in the pretzel subcategory  positions us well to make this a new permanent part of our product portfolio that should drive meaningful growth. We are also introducing on-the-go products like our cheese pourables.,0.1881412677175831,NEUTRAL
As you know  cheese balls are a strong product for us. But today are almost entirely sold in large barrels mostly in mass and club. Pourables is a product that is more on the go and appropriate for C-store and impulse in grocery and other channels.,0.3533739624544978,POSITIVE
And lastly  we have launched peanut butter-filled pretzels under the Utz Brand. This is an extension of the capabilities we acquired with H.K. Anderson. And we have high expectations for growth and innovation across  both the H.K. Anderson and Utz Brands.,0.22744180363952182,NEUTRAL
Early results are strong. And we will continue to innovate around the filled pretzel platform. In addition  we have a wide range of other innovations like  protein snacks  new flavors and textures and our    -year anniversary special products.,0.4496515374921728,POSITIVE
In summary  this year  we will continue to build on our strong foundation and execute against our strategic priorities that we believe will enhance shareholder value.

First  we gained a significant amount of new buyers in the salt and snack category  and our repeat rates are increasing.

Fourth  our infrastructure improvements will enable the Utz platform to continue to scale to greater heights.,0.13529644237132743,NEUTRAL
As Cary mentioned earlier  we are implementing a new ERP system  and we continue to convert to our DSD routes to independent operators.

Our strategy remains consistent  as we are focused on branded snacking in the US at attractive valuations that are accretive.,0.058387202603626065,NEUTRAL
On that note  our pipeline remains very active. And important to note  we are very excited to recognize the fact that Utz is officially     years old as a company this fall.

Yeah. Hey  Andrew  thanks very much. And you re right  on a full year basis  the core did extremely well  right  The Utz Brands platform did about     against a market of approximately     but as to your point for sure in Q  we had a little bit of a slowdown there relative to the market. We came in about  .   compared to  .  . So in our core markets  if you look at the PowerPoint presentation we have online sort of jumps around from the PAC Northwest to New Orleans to the mid-Atlantic to New England.,0.30847513023763895,POSITIVE
So it s a vary geography  and you can really dial into specific geographies and see where on a year-over-year basis  we have opportunity for improvement. It s a big part of our focus. We re laser-focused on it. We know that the core is as important as any of the growth that we have in emerging and expansion markets.

And so we re putting a laser focus on that. And just very importantly  our overarching objectives are that we want to gain share in our core.

Okay. Thank you for that. And then  I guess  lastly  I know the company has previously spoken of a mid-teen EBITDA margin target for I think it was discussed as sort of the medium term.

Cary Devore,-0.16583383828401566,NEGATIVE
Hey  Andrew  this is Cary. Great question. We re not updating the target per se. I mean  I think  it s safe to say that     EBITDA margin is the new baseline  from which to grow from  I think with our price pack initiatives with our productivity with our IO conversions coming to a completion here in the next    months  plus with long-term profitable branded volume growth. All that is margin-accretive  and then you layer in synergies we pull through in acquisitions.

Have we seen any change in promotional cadence or intensity in the competitive landscape  I m just curious whether that had any impact on what you re seeing ,0.2867113295942545,POSITIVE
Dylan Lissette,-0.0012548617087304592,NEUTRAL
I think we ve seen a little bit of that Brian. Obviously  we did really well throughout      as a brand. It doesn t matter if you re looking at it in any particular geography between core emerging or expansion  we did really well. We did really well in almost all of the channels that we operated in     . And I think from a competitive standpoint  obviously  we also went public and we also got on a larger scale and perhaps picked up some more notice from competition.,0.27832764212507755,POSITIVE
I think in general terms  I ve been at this for    years. And I wouldn t say that there s any major shift in promotional strategies across the salted snack category. I think people are looking where they stand in the stack of their share in particular sub-categories. If they re underweight in a certain subcategory  if they re underweight in certain shares looking at ways to perhaps drive share gains  but I haven t seen any dramatic shifts in pricing relative to that.,-0.08142650686204433,NEUTRAL
And as we look forward into       I think  there s opportunity for everyone in the industry to continue to look at price pack architecture and ways to promote and sell and it all comes down to depth and frequency and a multitude of ways to affect ultimate price points.,0.20742821926251054,NEUTRAL
Brian Holland,0.00043336383532732725,NEUTRAL
I appreciate the color Dylan. And then just moving this forward to       the revenue guide a fairly precise number in what s going to be a very volatile year one would think just compares  et cetera  and then you obviously have a lot of internal initiatives. So maybe a little more color on how we arrive  where we did  And so maybe just to help guide that question along. Can Truco for instance or On The Border specifically grow in       And are we thinking about those core markets just being pressured by the COVID comp and that s just fully offset by expansion in emerging market share  Because it seems like there s a lot of white space that you ll be attacking over the next    months ,-0.0013477951288223267,NEUTRAL
Cary Devore,-0.16583383828401566,NEGATIVE
Yes. Great question Brian  this is Cary. Yes  I would say just a little more color on the revenue guidance. I think we expect modest organic growth and that effectively means Utz. We expect distribution gains which are meaningful as we ve been building over time and going to your point about emerging and expansion that will continue to grow and outpace the category and we expect the core to do well as well. But I think distribution by and large will drive modest organic growth for us.,0.31241181679069996,POSITIVE
And Truco has a great playbook going forward. They ve got a lot of new distribution in the food and grocery channel. So  there s a lot of runway there but they have a more meaningful COVID lap than Utz does in terms of percentage of total business.,0.4898757135961205,POSITIVE
So  I think the expectation it lets Utz to grow modestly and we re seeing consistent growth for the year. Truco might be flat to down a little bit  but that s still very acceptable. It s a great business. There s a lot of long-term growth ahead of it. We bought it for a really good price. So  we re very happy with it.,0.49794080801075324,POSITIVE

Michael Lavery,0.0024248033441836014,NEUTRAL
Good morning. Thank you. You mentioned the favorable contracts you had in     . There were a benefit and now  of course  are part of your comp. You re guiding the    inflation that obviously  I m assuming would capture all of that  but can you just give a sense of where you sit now in terms of how much is hedged or locked in or kind of what sort of volatility there could be potentially to that    ,0.39654142898507416,POSITIVE
Dylan Lissette,-0.0012548617087304592,NEUTRAL
Yes. Great question Michael. We re about     covered for     . If you asked me before the Texas freeze what inflation would be for the year  we would have probably said less than     but that definitely had an impact on the markets and resin prices and that s kind of flowing through to packaging.,0.19280844181776047,POSITIVE
And so I think we think we got a really good supply chain team on purchasing. They bought oils really well and we re still seeing the benefit of that in     . So  as you think about inflation this year  it s primarily in packaging. I d say about half of that s in packaging  about     is in the cooking oil area because spot prices of cooking oil have gone up  but we are largely covered for the year  and then     in other categories.,0.31138126738369465,POSITIVE
Michael Lavery,0.0024248033441836014,NEUTRAL
Okay  great. That s really helpful. And then just a quick follow-up on productivity. You ve talked about the momentum there and how that should progress can you just give a little more sense of how much might be reinvested or versus dropping to the bottom-line and how you think about taking those benefits ,0.4773721800884232,POSITIVE
Dylan Lissette,-0.0012548617087304592,NEUTRAL
Yes. So  a meaningful increase this year. We re effectively doubling the percentage of COGS from    to    and that s on the US base by the way. And we ll be run rating higher than    as we exit the year but we re going to take some of that savings and certainly reinvest in marketing. We re going to spend more this year. We re leaning into digital and social.,0.11158771067857742,NEUTRAL
And the digital and e-comm piece of marketing should grow close to     this year. So  we will take some of that and reinvest in marketing like we said we would  but some of it s also going to help offset some of the inflationary pressures we re seeing this year.,-0.009259242564439774,NEUTRAL

Tim Perz,-0.002491480321623385,NEUTRAL
Thanks for the question guys. So  I just want to start with a bigger-picture question. I think the key opportunity for us longer-term is growing your number four and five share positions and the expansion in emerging categories. Do you think you have the brands in place today to do that and is the answer really just adding distribution assets in those regions or can you just walk me through how you re thinking about growing your business outside of your core markets ,0.29239271068945527,POSITIVE
Dylan Lissette,-0.0012548617087304592,NEUTRAL
Yes sure. Great question. So  I mean if you think about it we ve been growing continuously and contiguously across the United States for     years  more so in the last    years where we have been utilizing the M A strategy to grow geographically in many cases right Golden Flake in       the Tim s Cascade assets that we acquired in late      in the PAC Northwest  great example with Kitchen Cooked in Illinois and Vitner s in Illinois. And as we take over and acquire these companies and expand our geographic base  we have the opportunity to really push our branding into our Power Brands  which is really where we want to focus  right ,0.1916312207467854,NEUTRAL
We know that we re going to have some negative drag from Foundation Brands  because it s not where we re putting our focus  right  In the last year or so  we ve eliminated two or three of those Foundation Brands and they become a negative drag on your retail sales in some cases  but you re converting that space into your Power Brands  so that when we focus on marketing behind those Power Brands  we get the benefit from that.,-0.05585656501352787,MIXED
So  as we expand into the southeast  as we expand into Florida  as we expand into Texas  as we re currently expanding into Arizona  as we re increasing our sales and our share in the PAC Northwest  as we re going into the Midwest.,0.013405996607616544,NEUTRAL
The Midwest is a huge opportunity for us and showing great results  especially with the just consummated acquisition of Vitner s that we closed on February   of       we are already putting Utz branded products onto that network and pushing those into the Chicago market.,0.4180255742976442,POSITIVE
So  it s really a combination of just using sort of organic sort of zip code-by-zip code continuous growth across the US  but also some of that leapfrogging that we re able to do when we do some of our acquisition strategies to deliver an opportunity. And again  I think to Andrew s first question  without ignoring the fact that we want our core to also gain share over time  not just rely  of course  on emerging or expansion markets.,-0.016470827162265778,NEUTRAL
Tim Perz,-0.002491480321623385,NEUTRAL
Thanks. That was helpful. And I just wanted to pivot over to marketing. So you started your relationship with the Sasha Group in October  how is that relationship progressing and what have your early learnings been from your recent marketing investment spend ,0.3986302091507241,POSITIVE
Dylan Lissette,-0.0012548617087304592,NEUTRAL
Yes. I mean  it s going very well. I mean what a great dynamic group. And if you remember back to past calls and past conversations  what we re really trying to do is  a  spend more money on marketing  right  than we had historically spent. And when I say spend more money on marketing  I mean spend more on traditional  digital  social type of marketing  pulling away from what we have been spending some money on the past  which is sponsorships and putting more spend into traditional  social  digital type of media.,0.11324723809957504,MIXED
Sasha  which is a VaynerX company  the Sasha Group is just fantastic at that. And so  we have our team that does digital  social is fantastic. And I think it sort of shows in some of the e-commerce stuff that we put into our presentation where we ve really grown our e-commerce business  which is comprised of sort of  this is IRI  retail e-commerce as it s defined by IRI  which includes some of this click-and-collect and some of the other methods of getting product to people through e-commerce  has really grown over    -plus percent and we expect to continue into      and beyond.,0.38917192042572424,POSITIVE
So  we re really focusing to make sure that we re dynamic spending more money  significantly more money on social  on digital  on our brands  focusing in on Power Brands  making that     loop into e-commerce and really driving awareness. And I think through our new households that we picked up and our repeat rates and the things that we ve detailed in that presentation as well.,0.04170752107165754,NEUTRAL
I think you could say that we re happy so far. I always say never happy  but pleased  but not satisfied. We re very pleased  but we always think that we can improve  and so we ll spend      trying to improve that even more  which is the beauty of the marketing that we re doing is that we can literally change day-to-day on a dime if we have to spend that money effectively.,0.3999557294882834,POSITIVE

Robert Moskow,-0.00015464596799574792,NEUTRAL
Hi  thanks. A couple of follow-ups. Could you give us a couple more specifics on how you re going to implement pricing this year  You mentioned price pack architecture and also depth and frequency of promo  to what extent will list prices -- list price increases also be in that formula ,0.19084068085066974,NEUTRAL
And secondly  I wanted a little more depth on  ON THE BORDER. And it seems like there s significant revenue synergy opportunities with your Utz distribution platform. Are your Utz salespeople marketing that brand to their customers currently and has that yielded more distribution  or is ON THE BORDER s stand-alone business -- is it still  kind of  operating stand-alone and it has its own distribution plan  Thanks.,-0.33613536693155766,NEGATIVE
Dylan Lissette,-0.0012548617087304592,NEUTRAL
Yeah. Robert  I m going to tackle both of those. This is Dylan. I could probably give you    minutes on either one of those topics  but I ll try to do it in succinct way. In terms of pricing  in the snacking industry it s a little bit different. It s not just your typical list pricing initiatives. However  we have a very robust price pack architecture team that constantly analyzes the opportunities like I mentioned earlier about frequency  about depth. We did just do some pricing on March  th  which kicked in. Of course  it takes a little while for some of that to flow through the system with contracts and all the specifics of the thousands of accounts that we basically deal with on a daily basis.,0.2770738862454891,POSITIVE
So we do have some list and then we also have some weighed-out opportunities that we re enacting and some different things around that to really try to tackle offsetting some of the inflation concerns. So on that we have a lot of different levers. We re pulling all the levers and we re going to continue to lean into those levers on pricing.,0.005701705813407898,NEUTRAL
Flipping to your commentary about ON THE BORDER and the integration of sales and how that works. As we said at the very beginning  we did not look at ON THE BORDER as a cost synergy play from an M A perspective. We looked at it as a revenue synergy play from an M A perspective. So that team continues to sell day-in and day-out to their major customers on a DTW  direct-to-warehouse basis. That s impact that s going very well  they have great leadership  they have a great team. If you think about it  we re months into it right now. We re coalescing very well on all fronts.,0.1468014484271407,NEUTRAL
Our sales folks it s a little bit -- you have to unwind in some cases existing distribution and there s some complications there that you just have to unwind with any integration of M A. But  for example  in Chicago like within weeks of the acquisition being consummated  we were taking it through our route system  through our third-party distributor route system in Chicago into June  ph . For example  in Central Pennsylvania  we ve already turned over OTB distribution to the Utz DSD sales system. In Connecticut  we ve already turned it over to the Utz DSD sales system.,-0.1851686891168356,NEUTRAL
And so as we look forward  those opportunities are going to I think be very positive and very accretive to us because the brand sells and it s doing really well in the places that we ve been able to convert it. And when it is distributed  when it is sold  if you think about the sales team at OTB  I would garner to say there s  roughly eight people in sales.,0.404584928881377,POSITIVE
When you think about the sales team at Utz  I would garner to say  if you disregard the DSD sales force we still have over    -plus people that sell. So all of them are looking at OTB  and it s not just tortillas  its sauces  its dips  its cases.,-0.3258493598550558,NEGATIVE
It s all of the  product line-up that they have  that we can integrate into our almost       DSD routes  overtime  right  And I always think of things in a very long-term perspective  that overtime we re going to get those wins. And it s a great brand and selling well.,0.4936673932825215,POSITIVE

Hi. Good morning  folks. A couple of quick housekeeping questions  first  you mentioned contracts and the step-up to    inflation from modestly deflationary. Is that going to be a gradual ease in sort of giving you time to adjust if the productivity ramping  or are your rollover a cliff it had a little bit of friction on margins  as we enter the year ,0.09739817678928375,NEUTRAL
Dylan Lissette,-0.0012548617087304592,NEUTRAL
I think  it will be more second half-weighted. But I think we will see some pressure in the first half of the year. But we have the pricing starting to take effect. And productivity will layer in as well  to help offset that and that will be more back half-weighted as well.,0.1555701494216919,MIXED
Jason English,0.0024218986509367824,NEUTRAL

Dylan Lissette,-0.0012548617087304592,NEUTRAL
Yeah. So in the digital and social area  we are spending approximately     more in       than     . Part of that is incremental dollars for sure  part of that is also pulling out of sponsorship and moving the mix  into more digital and social.

Dylan Lissette,-0.0012548617087304592,NEUTRAL

So it is all interconnected. I think it s a great question. It s something we could probably follow up on more definitively.

As of December           we now have a total installed base of     systems worldwide. Additionally  a total of approximately       disposable treatment tips were sold globally in     .,0.019230269826948643,NEUTRAL
Total operating expenses for the year were approximately    .  million compared to    .  million for     . This significant decrease is the result of the company s strategic alignment  along with taking operational measures to lower costs and reduced cash burn as we focus our efforts on our SUI program. On a pro forma basis  we ended the year in a strong cash position  cash and cash equivalents including the net proceeds of    .  million from the company s January      financing were approximately    .  million.,-0.004688698798418045,NEUTRAL
The success of this upsized public offering in January was a testament to the enormous market opportunity for the Viveve s noninvasive  dual energy technology in SUI and underscores the confidence in the company s strategic path  capability to execute and potential to achieve positive clinical results in our U.S. pivotal PURSUIT trial.,0.24148327473085374,NEUTRAL
Importantly  this financing provided us with the capital resources to support operations through the end of       including the planned completion of the PURSUIT trial  and as we continue to operate efficiently and at a significantly reduced cash burn rate of    million to    million a quarter.,0.1109084421332227,NEUTRAL
I d now like to direct my remarks to our Stress Urinary Incontinence clinical development program. Our successful pivot to SUI in      was fostered by many important milestones that were achieved. These include the positive preclinical and SUI feasibility study results reported  positive data that validated our new inner sham treatment tip that produces no tissue  nor clinical benefit  FDA approval of the strengthened PURSUIT trial investigational device exemption  formation of our preeminent clinical advisory board and incontinence  and the issuance of a newly issued U.S.  SUI method patent.,0.21695152204483747,NEUTRAL
At this point I d like to summarize the condition of SUI and the opportunity it represents for those on the call who may be new to Viveve. SUI is a condition that affects an estimated    million to    million women in the United States alone  and based on our estimates  it represents a     billion to     billion total available consumable market opportunity.,0.029979240149259567,NEUTRAL
Today few effective  non-invasive treatments exist that reduce leakage associated with SUI. In fact  the current spectrum of therapeutic options for women is limited to physiotherapy at one end of the spectrum  such as Kegel exercises  electrical muscle stimulation or bio-feedback  which are all designed to strengthen the pelvic floor musculature.,0.030527144437655807,NEUTRAL
To the other end of the spectrum in invasive approaches such as bulking agents or sling procedures. Accordingly there s a large gap in the treatment spectrum that represent a tremendous unmet need and an opportunity for a clinically proven treatment option. We believe Viveve has the potential to expand this continuum of care.,0.04976645403075963,NEUTRAL
Our non-invasive  endovaginal  office-based treatment which can be completed in a physician s office in approximately    minutes  may safely and effectively improve urethra hypermobility and significantly reduce leakage for women who suffer from SUI.,0.19726507179439068,NEUTRAL
Moving to an overview of the PURSUIT trial  PURSUIT is a randomized  double-blinded  sham controlled trial with an intended enrollment of     subjects with moderate SUI  defined as greater than    milliliters up to    milliliters of urine leakage on the  -hour Pad Weight Test at up to    study sites in the United States. Randomized in a     ratio  subjects in the active treatment arm will receive our Cryogen-cooled Monopolar Radiofrequency or CMRF treatment  while subjects in the control arm will receive an energy less or inner sham treatment  and again I want to highlight that the sham treatment administered in the control group for the study is a clinically inert or a true sham treatment.,0.005996150895953178,NEUTRAL
The primary efficacy endpoint of PURSUIT trial in comparison of the proportion of patients who experience greater than a     reduction in urine leakage compared to baseline on the standardized and objective  -hour Pad Weight Test at    months post treatment versus the inner sham procedure.,0.0014296862646006048,NEUTRAL
The study also includes several secondary endpoints also assessed using the  -hour Pad Weight Test  the three day bladder voiding diary and other behavioral and quality of life questionnaire. Subject safety will also obviously be monitored throughout the study.,0.06359700299799442,NEUTRAL
I d like to take this moment to acknowledge the guidance and support from the many experts who make up our newly formed clinical advisory board and who contributed to our strengthened and enhanced study design.,0.25834639905951917,POSITIVE
Currently patient enrollment is under way and is going well and we continue to expect full     patient enrollment by the end of the second quarter or very early in the third quarter of this year. And again  positive data results from PURSUIT may support a marketing application for a new SUI label in the United States and abroad and open a multi-billion commercial opportunity for Viveve.,0.2319928223732859,NEUTRAL
Today  Viveve is in a strong position to successfully execute our core strategies over the next    to    months  in advance of and in preparation for a potential FDA approval of an SUI indication in the U.S. In      we now have the capital and resources to execute this strategy  a lower cash burn rate  a newly designed and highly powered pivotal SUI trial under way in the United States  and a shifted commercial priority to the two largest markets in the world  the United States and Asia Pacific regions  with a focus on expanding our core market installed base and procedure volumes  all in a      commercial environment that has begun to significantly improve.,0.0507281270402018,NEUTRAL
I thank the talented and dedicated team at Viveve for their tenacity throughout       which has provided us with this tremendous opportunity to potentially expand the SUI continuum of care with a non-invasive endovaginal treatment option for millions of women who suffer from SUI.,0.4990008853992549,POSITIVE

Okay  got it. And then back to your base business currently  could you talk about that a little more. It feels like there s some upside that this had on the utilization in the revenues. Could you call that out as far as geographies that you re seeing recently and obviously we don t expect any guidance  but it feels like at the moment     could be guided into     on the top line  at least from how we are looking at it ,-0.06606253795325756,MIXED
Scott Durbin,0.00047479050408583134,NEUTRAL
Yeah  we certain expect it to Jeff. You know      was obviously difficult  particularly in the United States where the Asia Pacific region recovered far more quickly in      and actually contributed quite strongly to the      results. But here at the beginning  as I mentioned in the prepared remarks and       I think it s   we are certain the market is improving  we re certainly seeing clinics that had to close down in       re-open up  order tips  start to treat patients  see and improve patient flow. So we re optimistic that we re on the up-tick here and that should translate into a better year for us from a financial perspective.,0.06951438263058662,NEUTRAL

Yeah  I think     to     is probably a good range in terms of increasing OpEx for     . We ve worked hard as you know over the last    months or so to sort of reduce the cash burn and start to level set the financial statements and improve just operational efficiency. And so we re going to continue to improve that as we go into      and while we ll see an uptick in      on the R D line due to the trial being mostly conducted this year  you know these are tremendously expensive trials and so it won t be significant.,0.17754681408405304,POSITIVE

Scott Durbin,0.00047479050408583134,NEUTRAL
Yeah  I think it s fair to say  you know we re at where we expect it to be. It s always a ramp up when you begin and we began   we announced enrollment on January      so it s been a little less than two months here. And then it tends to accelerate as you get all the sites up and screening and treating patients and dealing with the flow through of the various advertising campaigns that are going on locally around each of our clinic sites. And so you know right now we feel like we re on track to hit our enrollment target of the end of the second quarter or you know very early in July.,-0.11555533483624458,NEUTRAL

Scott Durbin,0.00047479050408583134,NEUTRAL
Well  we certainly hope so  and we re certainly on track for that right now. You know we obviously always wanted to go quicker. We knew we were going to face certain challenges coming into the execution of the trial from enrollment and follow-up perspective in this environment  but I think we learned a lot in      having run the feasibility study and you know try to incorporate those learning s into this very important study for us and I think we re on track and I expect we ll get you know right up to or at or very near to the    site at the end of the day.,0.336669260635972,POSITIVE
Ben Haynor,0.0008457239891868085,NEUTRAL
Okay. That s defiantly helpful. And then just looking at some of these secondary endpoints and it looks like you ve kind of altered them or at least a couple few on them since the original trial design came out before you boosted the patient count.,0.1443937048316002,POSITIVE
Can you maybe talk about some of these secondary end points and you know why you add some  or simple ones that are chosen. I mean it seems like there are few that maybe could help us kind of get the patient guidance on when they could expect the results  or was that a consideration. What went into some of these changes ,-0.004020990803837776,NEUTRAL
Scott Durbin,0.00047479050408583134,NEUTRAL
Yeah  I think the most important change is really the addition of the three month time point and that was really done for precisely the reason you just highlighted  which is you know if as we expect sort of to get to a positive outcome from this trial  it will be important from there as we achieve an FDA clearance and begin to be able to finally market on-label in the United States and elsewhere for SUI.,0.18800842575728893,NEUTRAL
That you know physicians have a sense for the on-set of improvement in symptoms or leakage and by adding the three month end-point it really gives a nice time history of improvement  because we can look back at voiding episodes  we can look at mean change from baseline on the Pad Weight Test in addition to responder rates  and really get a sense of the time sequence of outcome and that can be communicated to patients once we re on a label from the physician in terms of setting expectations. Because as you know  ours is a tissue mechanism of action that based on our history in the many clinical trials we ve run and the sort of vast commercial experience we have today  we know that it takes    to    days for the tissues to remodel and for women to start seeing clinical improvement in their symptoms. And so that s the main change to   is really adding the three month time point to the pad Weight Tests and to the voiding diary.,0.44575763918692246,POSITIVE
Ben Haynor,0.0008457239891868085,NEUTRAL
Got it. That makes a lot of sense and then  obviously SUI is an embracement conditions. So it makes sense that people are suffering from it or are kind of reluctant to discuss and that s why you get that kind of broad spectrum of estimates in terms of you know what s the number of women in the U.S. that have it.,0.12312000058591366,MIXED
But I did notice  it sounds like you re looking more at    million to    million based upon some of the prepared remarks  where you said in the press release  whereas like we caught you previously talking more or less kind of the    million range. Is that maybe including a little bit more of a mixed UI or why the higher figure now.,-0.41380469035357237,NEGATIVE
Scott Durbin,0.00047479050408583134,NEUTRAL
Yeah so  it s a great question and thanks for asking it  because I think it s important to clarify that when we talk about you know    million to    million women in the U.S. with you know with stress incontinence  its was some form of stress incontinence and as you know there s pure stress incontinence  there is pure urge incontinence and then there is this enormous population of patients who have a little bit of both  which they refer to as mixed.,0.15156699530780315,MIXED
And so when we talk about    million to    million women in the United States have some form of stress urinary incontinence  it s including pure SUI and most of the mix patience. But as you drill down on that and really what we re focused on  you know with stress in particular is making sure we re identifying patients who have predominant SUI  and so when we talk about    million or    million    million of those patients who would be candidates for as of the procedure  we re really honing in on those patients who are predominantly SUI and there are a variety of clinical mechanisms to differentiate whether a patient has more stress incontinence or more urge incontinence.,-0.0033662430942058563,MIXED
And so that s the difference in those two numbers Ben.,0.01583000458776951,NEUTRAL

Thank you  Joe and welcome everyone. Today I ll begin with some brief commentary on the current labor market and recent economic shifts  signaling positive signs for our industry and also share top level highlights of our Q  results. Herb will then provide additional detail and insight into our financial performance. And I will conclude with an overview of actions occurring in each of our business units to ensure continued momentum.,0.3925351762154605,POSITIVE
The old phrase   what a difference a year makes   certainly summed up the sentiment of the past several months. As we eclipsed the  -year anniversary of the pandemic onset  we are seeing several key indicators that support improving economic and labor conditions globally. Positive COVID cases have decreased significantly after hitting their highest levels during the recent winter months.,0.07951455004513264,NEUTRAL
More recently  positive cases seem to be leveling off as the race to distribute and administer COVID vaccine has begun. Since distribution began in December of       over     million doses have been administered in the United States. Recently  the CDC indicated that at the current pace     to     of the American population should receive at least the first dose of the vaccine indicating herd immunity by September of this year. This is fueling optimism as children begin their return to school  anticipation heightens for the ongoing reopening of all counties and states and comfort levels increase as even minimal activities that mirror the old norm occur.,-0.006200775504112244,NEUTRAL
Internationally  however  the trends suggest somewhat of a slower recovery pattern. Despite over    million vaccine doses administered to date in the locations Volt operates within Europe  Asia Pacific and India  recent recurring shutdowns and the introduction of new COVID-   variants has led to a non-linear recovery.,-0.09309286391362548,NEUTRAL
Looking back during March and April in       more than    million jobs were lost across the U.S. Through February of      nearly   .  million jobs have been gained  closing nearly     of the gap. Industries such as health care  specifically those providing travel nurses  leisure and hospitality  retail trade and manufacturing have led the way on the game. Even better news on the U.S. job front  temporary jobs are recovering at an even faster pace.,-0.10764968395233154,NEUTRAL
Since having lost nearly   million jobs last March and April  the temporary jobs segment has gained back nearly     of the lost jobs as of this February. This is consistent with what we re experiencing  particularly in the manufacturing  logistics and food distribution industry. Constraints on the talent supply continue to be our greatest challenge in fulfillment. We anticipate with broader distribution of the vaccine  combined with less state  county and city restrictions  this situation will improve.,-0.03896455466747284,NEUTRAL
As was the case with my earlier comments regarding international trends  we continue to see less substantive uplift in job openings. Speaking specifically about the United Kingdom  the number of new job postings remained broadly unchanged throughout the country s third lockdown  which began in early January as companies across multiple industries wait out the restriction.,-0.07736437162384391,NEUTRAL
A glimmer of optimism was recently shared by the Recruitment   Employment Confederation  highlighting a     increase in jobs posted in the first week of March     than in the first week of April      and     more than in the first week of July     synonymous with the initial recovery in the U.S. Despite these certain COVID-   business disruptions continuing domestically and abroad  the signs of an ongoing recovery which for Volt began in the latter half of fiscal      are encouraging.,-0.009009063243865967,MIXED
As we have previously reported  we realized consistent monthly sequential improvement beginning in July       coming from a combination of new business wins  existing client expansion and the return of certain clients to or near their pre-pandemic levels. This set the stage for strong momentum as we entered fiscal     in November.,0.24714641307946295,NEUTRAL

Thank you  Linda. Revenue for the first quarter of FY     on a GAAP basis was      million  compared to     .  million in the prior year comparable quarter  a slight improvement. After adjusting for currency translations and the MSP delivery model shift  overall company revenue was up   .  million due to continued improvements in our North American staffing segment  which posted positive year-over-year revenue growth for the first time in   years during the quarter.,0.44997210972360335,POSITIVE
During Q  FY      our Direct Hire line of business continued to show improvement. For the quarter  we were down  .   from the prior year quarter. However  we were up  .   sequentially from Q      . Direct Hire revenue within our North American staffing segment was higher versus the prior year quarter  but was offset by a decline within our international segment.,0.12511060759425163,NEUTRAL
Looking at Q        adjusted revenue for each segment  our North American staffing segment reported adjusted revenue of     .  million  an increase of  .   from the prior year.

Our International Staffing segment decreased   .  million or   .    primarily due to lower demand in the U.K.  and a decline in contractor headcount  which resulted from reductions clients made in anticipation of legislation that wants to take effect in April     .

Our North American Staffing segment margin increase was primarily due to these lower employee related costs  as well as a mix of higher margin business.

North American MSP decreased     basis points due to an increase in our payroll service.,-0.10600620601326227,NEUTRAL
SG A expense for Q       was    .  million compared to    .  million in the prior year quarter.

Operating loss for the quarter improved   .  million to   .  million compared to a loss of   .  million in the prior year comparable quarter.

For Q        we reported a GAAP net loss of   .  million or   .   per share  compared to a loss of    .  million or   .   per share in the prior year comparable quarter. This improvement was primarily due to the   .   reduction in operating expenses related to strategic cost initiatives as well as lower non-operating expenses and restructuring and severance costs.

Despite varying headwinds  each of our business units  International  North American MSP and North American Staffing had both sequential and per day revenue improvement when comparing Q       to Q      .

On the large enterprise client side  we continue to see increased buying activity  specifically in the areas of call center  manufacturing  logistics and food distribution.

As has been the case since July       order volume and placement volume remains well above pre-COVID timeframe  despite constrained talent supply.

We will continue to share more details as we progress.,0.10184945622313535,NEUTRAL
Our MSP segment providing total talent solutions to clients  looking for an outsourced approach to sourcing  engaging and managing contingent workforce continues to demonstrate slight recovery from the initial pandemic impact. This segment was extensively impacted by the decline of two large clients early in March  and new sales wins slowed as a result of limited buying activity throughout the last year.,0.005908991675823927,NEUTRAL
As we have reported  RSP  ph  activity has gradually improved in the last several months. Although these are generally long sales cycles  but generate significant margin uplift when new wins occur. We are fortunate to have a strong tenured team with extensive experience coupled with the agility and flexibility to offer scalable solutions for smaller and more complex programs globally. Our unprecedented client tenure is a testament to the outstanding program solution and partnership our MSP teams provide. We remain confident in a promising outlook for this segment.,0.33133682038169354,POSITIVE
On the international front  despite the ongoing headwinds previously referenced  we are beginning to realize incremental improvement specifically in the U.K. The outlook for this segment also remains promising and should continue to gain momentum as lockdowns end and a higher percentage of the population is vaccinated. In summary  I concur with Herb.

Great. Good to hear. Certainly impressive results coming out of fiscal     . I had a couple questions for you here. I guess the first point  obviously really impressive step down in SG A year-over-year and on a fairly similar base of revenue. So when we look at the savings when you think about labor facility costs  professional fees  what do you think is permanent and what may come back this year as volume picks up ,0.4944285550591303,POSITIVE
Herbert Mueller,0.0004861265915678814,NEUTRAL
Well  the reductions that we had are permanent. However  as we ve mentioned before  as we start growing and adding top line  we will be bringing back additional people into our sales force as we see opportunity to really be able to capitalize on that. I think we ve got a fair amount of room in our back office to not have to bring on additional support to support more revenue  but certainly on the revenue sales side  I think there s some opportunity there that we ll take advantage of and make sure that we re doing what we can out in the field.,0.17311169672757387,NEUTRAL
Josh Vogel,0.0012807109160348773,NEUTRAL
That s helpful. That actually kind of leads into my next question. I think on the last call  you quantify that revenue per employee increased  I think  like  a third in the U.S. I was just -- any thoughts you have around your current  indiscernible  recruiter bench and the existing capacity  How much is left there before you have to meaningfully add headcount ,0.2124076597392559,POSITIVE
Linda Perneau,0.008883032256562728,NEUTRAL
Yes  so I ll pick that one  Josh. We -- it varies  right. So the answer to that really varies depending upon what location  what area of the country  the specific dynamic that may be happening in any one particular location. We look at productivity  we look at it regularly. It s a metric that we measure to  it s a metric that our folks are incented by. So it s a very important metric for us. And we know that a certain productivity level in teams hit the glass ceiling  and they just simply cannot  cannot grow. And when we see that approaching  we re very quick to make an investment  right  We re making investments as we win new business  as we win new on site  as we re seeing a lot of our clients expand and buying activity pick up. So -- and then in other areas  we still have significant bandwidth  where those productivity levels are lower  might be more of a startup branch  or might be an area where we re just really looking to leverage. So it varies  but it is something that we monitor very closely. What we will continue to do  to Herb s point  is certainly look for additional cost savings opportunities  as we leverage technology and identify cost savings. And some of that will be offset by investments that will continue to make to fuel the growth.,0.07007912825793028,NEUTRAL
Josh Vogel,0.0012807109160348773,NEUTRAL

Josh  I think things right now are going very  very well. We ve been extremely pleased with the progress that we ve made there. Our team has gotten up to speed  very  very quickly  both from an accounting and shared service side. We ve got metrics on their performance  and they continue to come in excellent. We ve had a few people that haven t worked out  as you have in any situation  and we ve dealt with that situation quickly. And have really been very pleased. We went through  we ve got a fair amount of accounting support there. We just went through our year-end audit last  December  and it was one of the cleanest audits we ve had  we just had Q  and Q  was done  extremely well. So we re very pleased. Going forward  we re continuing to look  is there an opportunity or not certainly any time that we have a position that opens up through attrition or whatever  we evaluate. Does it make sense for us to replace that position in India or do we need to do it here  and we re handling that by case by case basis.,0.4994677595386747,POSITIVE

Sure. Okay  great. And now  switching to the revenue results   very encouraging   ph  to see what you put up in North America  and I don t know if it s easy to quantify  but when we think about  .   increase on an adjusted basis  what would that have looked like without COVID related impact  because I think you did quite a number in and around      million for last year  I was just curious  what was in this quarter  And then when we think about the growth you saw on the quarter  how much came from new client wins versus expansion with existing clients.,0.258814450353384,POSITIVE
Linda Perneau,0.008883032256562728,NEUTRAL

Josh Vogel,0.0012807109160348773,NEUTRAL
Yes  of course. Even also impressive  given your commentary around for Q  because the first seven weeks of that quarter. If I heard you right  Herb you said  you expect revenue to be up    to    year-over-year. In Q  -- okay  great. And so then you -- can you maybe give a sense of the drag from the winter storms that are built in that. If we didn t have that  what would that growth look like ,0.28346692863851786,POSITIVE
Herbert Mueller,0.0004861265915678814,NEUTRAL
Yes  and we re still seeing some impact from that  because you had the initial shutdown  that occurred  especially in Texas and Tennessee  where literally in Texas  especially for a week long  we had clients that were down. And then the other thing is the supply chain interruption. So we actually saw cutbacks in states that were not affected by the ice storms  but indirectly because they couldn t get the  indiscernible  the supply chain was disrupted. And we re still seeing a little bit of impact from that. And that s part of kind of the range  and if that doesn t recover quickly  you ll see us on the low end of that range. If it rebounds quickly  and you ve got things making up  we could do a little bit better  but we -- overall  it hasn t been horrendous  but also keep in mind  that you ve not only had the big ice storm that hit Texas and Tennessee  but before that you also had really bad weather in the Northeast  the Midwest  has been getting hit  Denver  just got  indiscernible . So that s something -- that is something we re watching closely  but right now there s an impact there    to    potentially  but knock on wood  not much more than that.,-0.0479404553771019,MIXED

 Foreign Language  As we review       we faced two major challenges. First  on the user front  although  the pandemic in the first half of the year brought us large scale users to consume pandemic-related needs and hot trends  it had a negative impact on the content generation of entertainment vertical and certain other areas such as  tourism and sports  which resulted in less user engagement in this sector.,-0.05568952194880694,NEUTRAL

So far we have seen an uptick of our overall traffic in the first quarter compared to last the December.,0.037571489810943604,NEUTRAL
 Foreign Language  Second on monetization. The pandemic has hit some sector of our business hard early last year. However  with a well-controlled pandemic situation and the recovery of the ad demand  Weibo s social marketing value proposition earned wider recognition among brand customers  leveraging our unique marketing offerings such as hot trends  celebrity and KOL marketing  as well as brand price performance solution. As a result  our brand ad revenues delivered a solid rebound in the second half of this year and achieved double-digit growth year-over-year in Q  with number of branding customers spending with us setting a new record.,0.03095642291009426,NEUTRAL
For performance ad business despite certain pressure from advertising and market competition  the decrease of our performance ad revenue in Q  further narrowed compared with prior quarters  mainly thanks to the fully upgraded ad bidding system  super FST and continued robust growth in gaming and education sectors under the brand plus performance model.,0.09374202019535005,NEUTRAL
Next  let me share some color on our progress in product and monetization in Q   as well as layout key initiatives for     . On the product front  starting from Q  last year  we further enhanced Weibo s differentiated competitiveness in hot trend and social attributes. Coupled with efficient channel strategies  we stabilized our user scale and further drove user engagement. Concurrently we also beefed up our investment in the video sector to strengthen users  mind set of using Weibo for video consumption so as to enhance our competitiveness in user acquisition.,0.06770520367717836,NEUTRAL
On the channel front  in Q   we optimized channel strategy for new and recalled users combined with hot trend and topic products. When hot events occur  we will encourage media accounts and KOLs to discuss around topics through product and operating mechanism  providing real-time topic-related content to users. With the optimized strategies to further enhance the platform s confidence in this recall and retention through hot trends  bringing our strength in content offering into supply. Taking the New Year s Eve as example  remember our New Year s Eve relating toward the pass      million  up      compared with last year and recalled more than    million users back to our platform.,0.024720795510802418,NEUTRAL
On the social front  for these users recalled through hot events or channel investment  we focus on improving their consumption depth and user frequency in the relationship-based feeds. To elaborate  we focus on improving user experience in relationship-based feeds to data mining and quality social content based on several dimensions  such as intimacy of social relations  frequency of visits  and amount of discussion by followers  et cetera. With such quality content offer  we could further deepen their consumption  as well as enhance user retention.,0.024289518369187135,NEUTRAL
Additionally  we focused on enhancing diversity of content distribution in the information feeds in order to drive user stickiness  interaction  and consumption. For instance  in the fourth quarter  we extended real-time consumption of video content through this simultaneous distribution in our core feeds. As a result  the effective time spend per user on a post really recommendation feed increased over     and the effect of video views posted each recommendation increased over      compared with Q .,0.027458914555609226,NEUTRAL
On the video front in       we reinforced our product offerings and operation mechanism and attracted a great number of quality video content creators to Weibo. In the second half of       we launched the video account program to incentivize Weibo s top content creators to shift toward video content generation  so as to encourage more video production and consumption. We saw a significant uplift in the number of video accounts. Currently  the number of registered video accounts has surpassed a million among  which over        video accounts already have more than   million followers per each.,0.06012366850336548,NEUTRAL
By verticals  there is a good proportion of video produced by top content creators in the media and variety show verticals  but we still need to increase that to many other sections on the platform. This year  we will continue to improve the overall experience for video accounts  scale-up video content generation among top content creators  as well as strengthen the effective distribution of video content in feeds and video community  so as to boost the video content consumption and improve the platform s overall video content ecosystem.,0.05845170823158696,NEUTRAL
 Foreign Language ,-0.004253280349075794,NEUTRAL
Let me briefly layout our strategies for      on the product and operation front. We seek to extend user base and engagement from the following three aspects.

On accounting system side  we will step up our efforts to empower top content creators to monetize within our ecosystem  which will in turn stimulate their content generation and interaction with fans  driving Weibo s user engagement.,0.00813853663566988,NEUTRAL
Finally  on video content  through video accounts we will accelerate the transformation of Weibo s key content creator group toward video creation and promote the supply and consumption of Weibo s video contents.

 Foreign Language  On the monetization front  our KA ad revenues in Q  increased     year-over-year. The rapid recovery of KA business in the second half of the year were mainly driven by the following factors  first of all  from the perspective of the market environment most industry sectors have returned to normal operation in the second half of the year and gradually resumed ad replacement except for few sectors such as entertainment tourism. That has not fully recovered from the pandemic. And meanwhile  the pandemic has further driven ad budget shift from offline to online. We saw top brand customers and also those emerging brands embracing Internet platforms as their major campaign arena.,-0.03081013821065426,NEUTRAL
Secondly  KA clients have shifted more of their budget from TV and long-form video platform to social and short-video platform and lowering the user engagement shift. With this trend  social platform had more strength in KA marketing.,0.014546749647706747,NEUTRAL
Finally in KA advertising  Weibo highlights its marketing strategies on KOL content IP and brand plus performance offering leveraging its robust content ecosystem.

In the second half of the year  we gradually extended such industry specific solutions to Internet service and some offline O O industries to capture the higher wallet from key industries.,0.02097435644827783,NEUTRAL
 Foreign Language  In       we will continue to enhance our monetization skill and efficiency from the following aspects  first  on ad products based on Weibo s unique attributes as a social media platform with younger users  we will continue to strengthen the competitiveness of our social ad products and further capture brand plus performance budget and KOL marketing ad dollars to reach more emerging clients as well as obtain incremental budget from middle tier and top clients.

So that is actually going to really help us to improve our competitiveness as well as our kind of inventory of the monetization.,0.21700688020791858,NEUTRAL
 Foreign Language  And also  in terms of our strategy in the future  in       we would like to focus on the following items. So first of all  we had our traditional advantage in terms of acquiring those users through our hot trends.,0.07658942058333196,NEUTRAL

So actually in       in Q   and also later this year  we are going to further emphasize on these two particular points. So that is to say  first of all  emphasizing on the consumptions related to the relationship-based feed.,0.0726557751186192,NEUTRAL
And also  we are going to encourage those video accounts to actually publish more videos. And also help and trigger the consumption around the videos by the users.

So actually we are very confident to overcome the difficulty and also get ourselves improved in later this year.,0.45816558599472046,POSITIVE
 Foreign Language  And also lastly  I want to say that in terms of the      trend. So first of all  talking about the year-on-year comparison  because we had a very high historical figure in Q  of       so it s not that meaningful for us to compare. But actually we are very confident to realize a month-to-month growth in      Q .,0.19196619372814894,POSITIVE
And also another thing is that in terms of our channel strategy  we are going to really focus on increasing the retention ratio of our users and also really help to build a very good and also healthy growth on the number of users.

 Foreign Language  Thank you for taking my question. So my question is  can you please share the ad spend outlook for the       And what  kind of  your ad products and services will particularly gain traction and gain incremental budget allocations among your KA and SME clients across different industry sectors  Thank you.,0.12827104283496737,NEUTRAL
Gaofei Wang,0.006808094913139939,NEUTRAL
 Foreign Language  And so let me answer this particular question. So first of all  in      Q   we have been seeing a very good recovery of our KA ad customer  especially we returned to the triple-digit growth. And also  we although had a year-on-year decrease on SME in Q   but still that particular decrease rate has been reduced. And also  further in       we re going to really see a kind of a very good growth on the brand customers  especially at the FMCG and also automotives  as well as the luxury as well. And also  in       we re going to see also a very good growth for entertainment as well.,0.4804970894474536,POSITIVE
And also  next part is about the SME. So this year  for example  we have seen a very good trend for gaming or Internet service  as well as online education  et cetera  et cetera  but actually we re not quite sure  whether or not we are going to see another doubling effect or doubling results of the gaming industry this year. And also  talking about the other  traffic diverting related SMEs  without a very strong demand on branding  actually in       we were talking about those O O or e-commerce businesses. We had a little bit -- another ideal performance in       but still in       we are going to see a further intense competition in the area that I mentioned.,-0.038868822157382965,NEUTRAL
And also  next part is about the products. So  based on the social nature of Weibo  so we are going to really focus continuously on the kind of the strategy of the brand plus performance and also the content and also IP-based marketing strategies. So based on this particular content and IP-based marketing  as well as the strategy of brand plus performance  we have very good advantage in gaining the budget from the top-notch customers.,0.170430407859385,NEUTRAL
And also  we do see that the  kind of  short video is actually a very big competitor through the OTV area. So we can see that in this particular thing. We do see that those customers from OTV actually had a very high requirement already kind of a content  and also the IP as well as the famous KOLs in this area. So based on the unique advantage of Weibo in terms of the IP and KOLs  and celebrities  we are very much positive to actually have the advantage of those OTV converted or transferred budgets and gaining that.,0.35470820497721434,POSITIVE
And also  next part is that  we had also a very good development in terms of our information flow  like the super FST has been upgraded further. So we are going to see a kind of a triple-digit growth on OCPX as well. And also  the gaming as well as the educations as two verticals are increasing dramatically and also  because of our upgraded algorithm in this particular area. And also  talking about those particular customers  they do have the requirement  not only to gain traffic  but also they would like to do some kind of a brand promotion work. So because of that we are seeing that in       we re very much positive to actually have that particular development  especially talking about the customer and e-commerce and also Internet services  et cetera.,0.18140923231840134,NEUTRAL

Hi  good evening. Thank you for taking my questions. Also  congratulations on the results and the guidance. My questions is related to the ad inventory and also the competitive landscape. So  how does management elaborate the situation you are seeing in      versus last year in terms of the ad pricing pressure and the supply for these ad inventory as compared to last year and even as compared to       And also  any comment on the margins trend for     . Let me translate very quickly.  Foreign Language ,0.46664783827145584,POSITIVE
Gaofei Wang,0.006808094913139939,NEUTRAL
 Foreign Language  So first of all  talking about the ad inventory  so before in the first question and also to that first question I already mentioned that actually this year in terms of our strategies for the users  we are going to actually see that more of our investment and also the product-related strategies are going to focus more on the DAU and also the consumption frequency of the users and the per capita consumption traffic of the users from the previous major focus on MAU. So that s to say this particular DAU increase and also more frequency of the consumption of users will definitely drive the development and growth of the ad inventory.,-0.055067138746380806,NEUTRAL
However  kind of  speaking based on the Q  result it s very difficult for me to give you a kind of forecast about this particular ad inventory in       especially  for Q . And of course  we do have seen very good growth on the other video platforms  but still we are very much focused on increasing the DAU and also the frequency of consumption of users and these strategies will definitely bring a growth on the ad inventory.,-0.001751728355884552,MIXED

In terms of your margin question  I will try to take this question. With the revenue growth as our primary goal and at the same time  we want to enhance our competitiveness of our platform so we may increase our investment in marketing channels compared to last year     . So on this basis we expect our operating margin can still reach well in the high level that is to say maybe no less than      but there still will be a certain decline maybe the impact the decline will be single-digit maybe    compared to the level of last year.,-0.010779496282339096,NEUTRAL
So in summary in this year  the company s all of strategies is mainly focused on improving our revenue growth and continue to improve the competitiveness of the platform at the user product level so the cost and expenses level. The main areas of investment will be increased will improve the marketing channel investment.,0.009063190838787705,NEUTRAL
In last year       due to the epidemic and other impact market channel investment was conservative that is down from the year     . So considering the competitive user market and leveraging Weibo s relatively advantaged new user acquisition costs  we will ensure our coverage of basic channels such as free installation and focus on increasing the investment in user engagement.,-0.03366118390113115,NEUTRAL
And another area is personnel-related costs. To maintain -- in order to maintain our competitiveness in the market in some key departments as such our advertising business department and our R D department there are certain personnel increase  headcount increase and also the salary raise. So last year due to the impact of the pandemic  the company also enjoyed some government benefit. This will impact our margin this year. So in summary  the effect on our margin will be dropped from year-to-year.,-0.10119082452729344,NEUTRAL

Tyler Langton,0.0043489164527272806,NEUTRAL
Yeah. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just maybe just starting with Salobo. I know you mentioned sort of you re expecting higher production sort of this year. Can you just talk a little bit about the profile you expect for this year and the next couple of years  it s kind of maybe relative to sort of the more normal levels that we saw in      ,0.1561485342681408,NEUTRAL
Randy Smallwood,0.0003072816471103579,NEUTRAL
Sure  Tyler. And thanks again for picking up coverage of Wheaton  appreciate having you on board and joining the team or the family. On the Salobo  Salobo it s all very exciting what we see over the next few years at Salobo. Obviously  I think they re about mi-          mechanically completed the end of the year on the Phase   expansion. And that s expected the turn on the switches sometime in     . And they re hopeful to sort of to get the completion test satisfied on that third phase of expansion by the end of     .,0.38025964610278606,POSITIVE
And so  as I said  a     increase in throughput  the current practice at the mine site is that they stockpile lower grade material in common with a lot of the large open pit copper mines around the world. They stockpile lower grade material and focus on processing higher grade material through the mill  that s current practice. They haven t made a final decision yet as to their approach once the third phase opens-up.,-0.03182731010019779,NEUTRAL
Economically  it makes sense for a stockpiled approach and in fact  we ve got some incentives provided to continue to hopefully push Vale down that path in terms of continuing the stockpiling approach. But they haven t made that decision yet. So  it s a little bit tough for us to give an accurate forecast over the next few years in terms of how Phase   is going to impact production.,-0.03465002775192261,MIXED
Our approach in our production forecast is that we ve assumed that they re not going to stockpile that. We re going to push things through. So  we think that s a pretty conservative approach. We think it has an inverse conservative aspect to our own production forecast for      and beyond. Because economically  we do think it does make sense for them to continue this stockpiling approach in setting aside lower grade materials and pushing higher grade materials through the mill.,-0.015066154301166534,NEUTRAL
A particular excitement though  on top of that is the back in December  Vale again announced the Phase   expansion. It s the first time that they ve discussed it publicly. We ve had obviously discussions with them extensively on this  but they ve discussed it  or released it publicly.,0.2339684907346964,POSITIVE
And that would involve another increase in equal increase of capacity  which would take it from        tonnes per day up to         tonnes per day. And expectations are that they would have that up and running by     . And so  lots of lots of activity at Salobo  lots of growth at Salobo.

Okay. That s helpful. And then just switching to sort of M A. I mean you mentioned some of the pipeline remains robust. Can you just talk a little bit about sort of the types of deals you re seeing in terms of size and whether it s more base metal producers looking to do precious metal streams  or on the precious metal side  just any color there will be great.,0.304018153809011,POSITIVE

Just to give you a bit of an overview  it s been pretty busy since the new year started  lots of new opportunities to look at  they re primarily development stage opportunities that fit into a lot of into our early deposit structure  which we ve done a few times. And that s where we take precious metals as a byproduct from a basement mine.,0.05026853457093239,NEUTRAL
These types of opportunities  obviously  is where streaming works best. There s also some opportunities that focus on balance sheet repair  and so expansion stage opportunity as well  where streaming can actually fund some of those expanses. The fact that streaming is being considered for all these areas actually further highlights the competitive cost of capital as streams provide.,0.0831018965691328,NEUTRAL
But there are some royalty factors out there that we ve seen in the past. But I can tell you  there s nothing that made sense from a Wheaton perspective  in large part because of their size or because they come with a significant amount of non-precious metal revenues. We re going to continue to focus on the larger  I would say development stage and expansion stage opportunities we re seeing right now.,-0.015102043747901917,MIXED
Randy Smallwood,0.0003072816471103579,NEUTRAL
I would just add that what we re seeing is a lot of base metals growth  base metal companies with the kick up in copper prices and other base metals  there s a lot of companies that are now looking at putting back into the ground. And so that s probably the biggest changes. And then  of course a lot of those assets have precious metal byproduct streams that will provide a good competitive source of capital to help these companies grow.,-0.021970480680465698,NEUTRAL

Ralph Profiti,0.296907763928175,POSITIVE
Good morning  everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. Randy  I just had one and I wanted to come back to Salobo. And the potential for Phase  . Should we be thinking about that as sort of more of an underground operation perhaps even moving to a block cave  Or is this just sort of a systemic  extra    million tonnes per annum being tacked on ,0.3824391597881913,POSITIVE
And then and I guess the second question is  when you think about that incremental investment that Wheaton would  be inclined to pursue. Should we just sort of take the old agreement  which would come in around say     million contribution ,-0.09469105582684278,NEUTRAL
Randy Smallwood,0.0003072816471103579,NEUTRAL
Yeah  so I mean  I actually personally believe that there is potential for block cave ultimately  but I can tell you that the reserves that we have within open pit at Salobo are going to be -- the Phase   expansion would be related to expansion of open pit operations  that wouldn t be related to any  any of the block cave side. But there s no doubt that long term potential for underground operations at Salobo does exist  is just we still got I think     plus    plus years of reserves in front of us  even with the expansion throughput there. And so  I think it ll be an open pit for a very  very long time. And Phase   is related to open pit production. And then  sorry  second part of the question.,0.05829792097210884,NEUTRAL
The reality is Vale has one opportunity to ask us for payment and we would expect that they would ask us for payment on the completion of phase   and that s a payment of somewhere in the neighborhood of   assuming that they complete   satisfy the completion test in      of      million to      million and that s the last of our contingent payments related to Salobo. So if they expand to Phase   there is no additional payment that Wheaton would make.,-0.010512402281165123,NEUTRAL
Gary Brown,0.00029426245600916445,NEUTRAL
Yeah  just to reiterate  it s one-time option that Vale have to collect an expansion payment. And so it s their choice as to collect it at the end of Phase   or reserve it till the end of the phase  . The payment of course  increases with scale  but decreases with time. And so it s  we fully expect them to be exercising that onetime option at the end of the phase  once they satisfy the completion test on phase  .,-0.19299457129091024,NEUTRAL

Josh Wolfson,0.00041706141200847924,NEUTRAL
Thanks  hi good morning. Continuing on the theme at Salobo here  with this next opportunity on the stockpiling is there any sort of timeline that you can provide in terms of when we could expect and update and ingest maybe from a technical perspective  is there anything to prevent the company from making this decision at a later date versus before the expansion is finished.,0.2533947145566344,POSITIVE
Randy Smallwood,0.0003072816471103579,NEUTRAL
Well so the driving from a critical timeline perspective  the only real difference at the site itself would be a bit of surface preparation but it s the mobile equipment fleet size that would have to be adjusted. And in my experience  all that takes as      Caterpillar Komatsu both find a way to get that. And so  that s not a critical  that doesn t take a lot of time to make adjustments to in terms of the size of the mobile fleet.,-0.02137940190732479,MIXED
But obviously  the slightly larger mobile fleet is going to be stockpiling some of the material versus feeding it all to the mill. It just means more material being moved on a daily basis. And so  that s kind of the critical path coming from the other end back. We have the updated resource which is now public. But we don t have the updated reserve yet  because we haven t actually made the final decision as to what plan is going forward.,-0.13480012025684118,MIXED
But the fact that the resource is in place  means it s really the matter of their engineering teams  their technical teams  the entire group sort of coming down to that position. We re of course  hopeful that it happen sometime the area the better discussion gives us that much more clarity on a go forward basis. And we definitely dangled the incentives there from the different in the expansion payments that we make. And so  we re hopeful that it s sometime in the first half of this year we re confident that it will be sometime this year. But it should be in the first half of this year.,0.031994909048080444,MIXED
Josh Wolfson,0.00041706141200847924,NEUTRAL
Okay  fits here. And along the other operations for Vale  for Voisey s Bay could you provide an update on how that operation will I guess ramp up or look like over the course of this year given you re going to get on the open pit material but the end we re ramping up and then a follow on question to that historically one of the opportunities cited has been maybe cobalt marketing just given the jurisdiction of the asset operates in. And if you have any views on that today with the production commencing  that would be an interest ,-0.05385861545801163,NEUTRAL
Randy Smallwood,0.0003072816471103579,NEUTRAL
Sure. Okay. Well  let s start off with the actual asset itself. So  you re correct. I mean  the underground was the delayed meaning is a result of some suspensions in production that they had on site last year  as a result of the pandemic. In a weird way  it s a little bit of a positive for us  because material that would have been mined last year was pushed into this year  but it has delayed the start of the underground.,-0.20214306097477674,MIXED
For us  it s not really a ramp up  because the production levels are pretty consistent from open pit to underground in terms of the material. So  we re getting pretty good production flows already from the open pit. And it s as of January  st  irrespective of whether it comes from open pit or underground. And so  as the underground does come into play  it ll obviously offset  and we ve got the open pit there as a dampening device to make sure that we have been consistent production from the pit itself. So  things are looking good there.,0.04080640897154808,MIXED
From the marketing side  I can tell you  we went through a product marketing request for proposals  and we had very  very strong interest in our product. We ultimately did select a marketing agent that is working through. This is a product that s well known  it s been produced for a long time and so there is great high demand for the cobalt from Voisey s Bay. And so  we re pretty happy with what we ve seen in terms of -- we ve now seen our first sales and we re pretty happy with the way that s handling.,0.4926299195358297,POSITIVE
The recent pricing action in cobalt  and some of the challenges that we ve seen elsewhere around the world from other production has really sort of timed itself very well for us to start receiving our cobalt production here. And so  this is a new product for us. And it s a new method of marketing for us in terms of being a bulk product versus story or precious metals. And so  we re really looking at these first couple of years as an opportunity to learn more about this market and see if there s ways we can further optimize it.,0.28274418227374554,POSITIVE

Cozamin that we certainly had -- did that acquisition in December  that we announced it. So that would be certainly included in     . I can tell you  though  we did use a conservative approach.

Randy Smallwood,0.0003072816471103579,NEUTRAL
So  the startup was a little bit challenged  mainly because of COVID risk management. October  November  there was a second wave sort of came through. And so  there was an increase in restrictions  and then it definitely made the start-up challenging for them in terms of getting staff in there safely  and making sure that they were maintaining high risk management protocols  that that definitely made it a little bit more challenging for them to get it up and running smoothly.,-0.005196603946387768,MIXED
But they were successful in getting first production through. That s a concentrate for us that gets shipped off.

They are getting some good  very  very impressive grades out of the underground.,0.45905970479361713,POSITIVE

But also  just the continued optimization of the mill  improvements in terms of throughput and recovery rates and investing back into it. San Dimas is even after this morning  San Dimas is First Majestic flagship. And so  it s always going to be a core focus of their investment. We were comfortable shareholders and supportive shareholders of them. But  we saw an opportunity to also stay focused and we re also very  very bullish on silver. But we re very comfortable with that. So  in terms of rate of return  Gary.,0.45669347420334816,POSITIVE
Gary Brown,0.00029426245600916445,NEUTRAL
Yeah. Look  Brian  you have to realize we view the San Dimas restructuring that we did back in       as a very successful transaction  and a real win-win transaction. One that has benefited First Majestic who s done a wonderful job with the asset with the exploration success that they ve had.,0.45482878806069493,POSITIVE
But the original stream  we received -- the current stream  and the current stream  we modified the stream  so that we were getting about     of what we were previously getting  and the     that we gave up  we received      million of First Majestic shares. And so  you have to take that in into account. So  we got      million  and then the Gold Corp gave us     million to get rid of their guarantee relative to that asset. So  we received      million for the original stream.,-0.12477429211139679,NEUTRAL
Now  we ve received      million so far on December          in proceeds from selling the First Majestic shares  and we had about      million of First Majestic shares at year end. So  let s call it      million  relative to our original valuation of      million. So  we ve generated as at December          about a     return on the First Majestic shares  and that s reflective of the fantastic job that First Majestic has done with San Dimas.,0.11880634538829327,NEUTRAL
And that combined with  you have to remember  we are dealing with about a       gold price environment when we consummated that deal. So  with gold being up over      since then. The combination of those two things has resulted in a very significant return. On the stream  we have received over     million to-date on the amended stream. And  the mine life there has been extended significantly with the exploration success that First Majestic has had. So  that I think was a very successful restructuring. And we re very happy with the way that that asset is performing.,0.4272667574696243,POSITIVE
Brian MacArthur,0.00015824049478396773,NEUTRAL
Great. Thanks. So maybe just a second question on the Voisey s Bay deal  technically and with all this talk about marketing  and as you ve mentioned it s a premium product. Is the reference  what is actually the reference price for the cobalt price that you re going to get post marketing  I mean  if we get into a situation where you had a two-tiered market or something. It is technically -- I just can t remember  is it technically defined to reference a certain price  Or is there some potential ,0.07283139228820801,POSITIVE
Randy Smallwood,0.0003072816471103579,NEUTRAL
Yeah  Brian  we currently have an agency agreement  where we sell it with block prices over the period. And so obviously  we monitor the spot market prices  but each block that gets sold is assigned a price at the time of the transaction itself  on a go forward basis. So  there s a number of different reference points out there  or reference prices out there.,-0.1234356053173542,NEUTRAL

Gary Brown,0.00029426245600916445,NEUTRAL
Yeah  Brian  it s going to be difficult because there s used to be metals bullets but I think they may have changed their name. Was the reference -- it was most applicable LME isn t a great proxy  but what the LME price  if you look at that will give you a proportional or directional movement. You can look at LME  and you can see LME prices have gone from mid-teens to well into mid-  s.,-0.06664126832038164,MIXED

Brian MacArthur,0.00015824049478396773,NEUTRAL
Right. But just so I m clear if I mean  there is a philosophical discussion out there in the market that  cobalt from Canada might be worth more than cobalt from  let s say  places in Africa. It would be a negotiated thing. And clients wanted to pay a premium for the stuff from Canada  it would be negotiated price three-year mark to your agency that technically you would get a premium if you could do that.

Richard Hatch,0.0006794854634790681,NEUTRAL
Thanks very much. And good morning  management and team and congrats on better detailed numbers. I got a few questions. The first one just Voisey s Bay  I wonder if he might just be able to put a bit more meat on the bones of what you could potentially kind of realize in terms of production levels  just on the various meals. I appreciate  it s quite difficult necessarily to have a full picture there. But would you be able to give us any kind of sort of stare on the various sort of three and four expansion  what that could take production levels to ,0.47935631102882326,POSITIVE
Randy Smallwood,0.0003072816471103579,NEUTRAL
Well  what I can tell you is the amount of tonnes that each one of those expansions relates to.,0.15411461889743805,POSITIVE
Currently  the mine is running at around a        tonne per day capacity. The Phase   will take it from        to        tonnes per day. And the Phase    the proposed Phase    it s not definite yet by any means. But it sure looks like it s shaping up will be another        tonnes per day.,-0.025239702314138412,NEUTRAL
So  it will take the mine ultimately from currently        tonnes per day to         tonnes per day  which still  when you look at copper mines around the world  is a large open pit copper mines around the world  it s not the largest in the world by any means is that s a pretty normal operating rate. And in fact  very similar to what we see at Pe asquito where there s even higher strip ratios.,0.0029686465859413147,NEUTRAL
So now the question is  what grade do they choose and stockpiling and it s very tough. I mean  we know that currently  right now  they are stockpiling lower grade material. They have been ever since  they started up the back in     . And setting aside the lower grade material and building up a low-grade stockpile  which will ultimately at the very end of the mine life be processed through the mill. And they are doing that.,-0.25236082449555397,NEGATIVE
And so current production levels sort of do reflect the stockpiling approach. Now we know that  it s easy for us to forecast and in fact  that s what we have included in our long-term forward forecasts is assuming that they process all ore mined through the mill and do not stockpiling and stop stockpiling. And we feel that that s a very conservative base case  we feel there s definitely outside of over and above that.,0.07442217320203781,NEUTRAL
However  the quantum of the amount of material that they stockpile  if they keep on using the same practices they have right now  you would imply that there s a possibility of some of a     increase this time around. But there s it s just not going to be like that. Typically  when you scale up in terms of capacity throughputs any crossover grades for stockpiling will drop a bit as you sort of adapt to that higher capacity to the mill.,-0.20143842324614525,MIXED
And so  it s a very broad spectrum of possible results. But they just  it s tough for us to put any more guidance on it other than the fact that we re confident that it ll be higher than what we ve got in our corporate forecast. But the quantum higher really does come down to how much material they decide to set aside in the stockpiling campaign material  they decided to move it through the mill.,-0.023067135363817215,MIXED
And it is an entire spectrum of results  that it s very flexible on their side. What I can  again  reinforces the fact that not only do we feel it makes economic sense for the continued stockpiling  but there is a pretty healthy incentive  as Gary mentioned earlier on  but      million incentive over and above their expensive payment if they commit to continuous stockpiling program and focus our grade materials through the mill.,0.47999904153402895,POSITIVE
And so  so the combination of strong economic -- stronger economics plus that incentive  we do hope that they make the decision  but in the end  it s Vale s decision as to their approach there. And I just wish I could give you more guidance on that  but I can t.,-0.27605582401156425,NEGATIVE
Richard Hatch,0.0006794854634790681,NEUTRAL

Randy Smallwood,0.0003072816471103579,NEUTRAL
Well  we haven t coming on about six years now. But that s  we actually think Hudbay is making good progress on their discussions with  in terms of the appeal of that decision  and in fact  Hudbay s own guidance is that they expect to announce or hopefully get to a decision point sometime here within the next  I think it s a few months  actually  within this year  definitely.,0.07022402808070183,NEUTRAL
And so  given that there s about a  .  to   year build time on happy and there is a reasonable chance that they could move forward. And even if they re not successful in appealing the recent decision  they do have the opportunity to try and shift the operations on the privately owned land  and move forward  it would be a smaller scale operation that really doesn t make sense. But sometimes you are forced to do things that don t make sense in order to get around these challenges.,-0.062159452587366104,MIXED
But they are definitely making good progress on that front. And we re confident that they ll be successful. And in that event  there s  we think  a pretty good chance  it ll come with it our five-year guidance  but we just felt  again  to be on the conservative side  we re confident they ll get there. But even if it wasn t the five years  we probably wouldn t see it until the fifth year  that five-year guidance.,0.2120894445106387,MIXED
And so  it really is  it s something that s going to be out. And I think  good chance  it ll be six years old  seven years old. And so  we ve got sort of supplying production through the six years -- six to    of the   -year guidance.,0.1328301690518856,NEUTRAL

Randy Smallwood,0.0003072816471103579,NEUTRAL
Well  it s important to keep in mind that we do average  our dividend over the previous four quarters of cash flows. And so as we see this organic growth that we ve just discussed  over the next few years  we know that there s going to be upward pressure on this dividend  just by virtue of the fact that we do tie it to our cash flows. And if we see some renewed strength in precious metal prices  that ll also put upward pressure on that dividend. And so  it s naturally going to be there.,0.051043889950960875,NEUTRAL
Richard  I can tell you that  that we re focused on trying to add to our portfolio. And if we re successful  no  we only do it into accretive.

And so  we are very  very selective about what we invest into. But our objective is to continue growing the company with ounces in the ground.

Good to say  so Randy  and forgive me for the ultimate last syllable question. Could you just maybe briefly talk a little bit about the relationship between the copper and the gold  And how if you re going to see sustained higher copper prices  does that work towards Vale making a decision either one way or the other on the stockpiling issue in terms of the expansion ,0.08251331746578217,NEUTRAL
Randy Smallwood,0.0003072816471103579,NEUTRAL
There s no doubt it has an impact on that because they get      of the copper revenue and about     of the gold revenue. So  the higher copper prices will definitely incentivize them to push that forward. There is on a more global corporate basis down there  Vale has a very continually every time you ever see them present  if they re constantly focused on trying to expand their presence in base metals. They have a lot of exposure to iron ore and it s a continual message that the expectation is to try and double the contribution from the base metals division of Vale. And Salobo  Salobo   is continually referenced. I was at a panel discussion around this week  where the BDAC where it was referenced.,0.1403916496783495,NEUTRAL

In Pottery Barn kids and teen  we have amplified our leadership in design and sustainability in the children s home furnishings business.

In addition to strong core introductions of furniture  we have added a new modern aesthetic that is growing at over     and attracting new customers to our brands.,0.33551420163712464,POSITIVE
Another example of growth is our baby business. Our baby business saw     growth last year and we are actively targeting the   billion plus baby registry market. West Elm has truly become the home furnishings brand of choice for millennials and millennial minded people. We continue to build the business with original design and by filling out white space and underdeveloped categories.,0.17316526250215247,NEUTRAL
For example  this year we maturely expanded into seasonal d cor  a historically small business for the brand. In the holiday season  we sold out with many of the products within the first couple weeks of launch  which built a strong foundation for further incremental volume in the years to come. Another category we are aggressively going after is outdoor. Currently West Elm s outdoor business is less than half the size of Pottery Barn and doubling this business would drive an incremental    growth for the West Elm brand.,0.08828077558428049,NEUTRAL
Now I d like to talk about William-Sonoma. This year marked the dramatic change in strategy for the brand. We implemented a content driven marketing strategy that featured exclusive products and relevant lifestyle stories instead of promotions. We also grew our exclusive products to     of our total business. This has been one of our key strategic initiatives to increase the mix of products only available at William-Sonoma which has grown from     to     in the last five years.,0.07162747229449451,NEUTRAL
Looking ahead we ll be even more aggressive in growing our exclusive product  which we expect to reach over     of our total business by the end of FY    . We also see significant opportunities in categories that are underdeveloped including the high-end luxury furniture market. Our William-Sonoma home brand is significantly underrepresented in this market and represents a substantial opportunity to drive growth and gain market share for the William-Sonoma brand.,0.1594215365475975,NEUTRAL
In addition to growth in our brands  we also have growth in new customer segments such as business to business and the global home category. We are building our mighty business-to-business  team   ph  and we are accelerating in sales volume across multiple industry verticals. Last year we drove over     million of revenues and we expect this business to surpass     million this year. In our global business our strategy for growth is through the capital life franchise model. We plan to double our revenues globally in the next five years led by the continued expansion of West Elm growth in our franchise operations as well as in our Canada e-commerce business.,0.0798742574697826,NEUTRAL
Our second differentiator is our digital first channel strategy. One of the key reasons we outperformed was because our e-commerce platform was able to serve our customers at scale. We are uniquely positioned to take market share as the home industry shifts online. We are already the number one non-pure play e-commerce retailer in home furnishings and the top    e-commerce retailer in the U.S. across all industries and today our business is over     e-commerce.,0.0970221006864449,NEUTRAL
In our digital channels we have been acquiring new customers at record rates all year and our customer retention metrics continue to improve among new customers. We have the platform  the supply chain infrastructure  the tech stack and the talent to push our growth in e-commerce even higher. We are digital first  but not digital only. Our stores are competitive advantage that support our online business for customers who want to experience our products in person as well as for those who prefer the convenience of our omni-channel services.,0.07008332975965459,NEUTRAL
In the past quarter we increased our total buy online  pickup in store and ship from source sales by over      as we leverage our retail network as fulfillment hubs. This is a huge unlock for our distribution operations and it is one of the reasons we were able to fulfill higher than expected volumes this holiday season despite gridlock issues that impacted the industry. As we look ahead  our future growth will be driven predominantly by e-commerce. One of the key advantages of having built our tech platform in-house is that we are able to implement and test new initiatives quickly and adjust based on customer feedback.,0.15346042136661708,NEUTRAL
We already have several initiatives planned to further enhance customer engagement and conversion online. You also see our  D visualization capability come to life as we introduce new functionalities to our design crew room planner including immersive multi-product AR room layouts and     degree experiences. These enhancements are important because this tool drives sales. We saw a significant increase in the usage of this tool by our design associates and customers this year with total plans created a     compared to last year. Also those who utilize this tool currently generate twice as many sales as non-users.,0.16668672300875187,NEUTRAL
In our supply chain we are aggressively expanding our U.S. manufacturing and fulfillment capability by over     to     next year including adding close to   million square feet of distribution space to our delivery network.

To help mitigate industry-wide shipping constraints and higher costs we will test and expand our in-home delivery to include small packages in addition to leveraging our omni-channel network.,0.0580342214598204,NEUTRAL
Being digital first also enables us to explore new offerings and business models such as marketplace. Our marketplace assortment is of the same superior quality as the rest of our products often exclusive and sourced from our trusted socially responsible vendor base. Marketplace also leverages our website reach and is capital light. This year marketplace was just over    of our total business and we are planning to almost triple its size in the next five years.,0.2576659775804728,POSITIVE
Our third differentiator is our values. We care deeply about sustainability  equity action  and supporting our associates in the communities where we work. Our commitment to sustainability is one of the main reasons our customers choose us over our competitors. For example  a recent survey found that our Pottery Barn customers are three times more likely to be in the top environmentally focused households. There is a direct correlation between the good work we are doing in the world and our increasing relevance with our customers and we are thrilled to be recognized for the work in this area. Just last month we were ranked at number    on Barron s     most sustainable companies up from    last year and we are continuing our recognition as the only home furnishings retailer on the entire Barron s list.,0.1931636958324816,NEUTRAL
As we look to the future  we will deepen our sustainability commitments further. Our Pottery Barn brand kicked off the New Year with a commitment to plant   million trees in three years where we will plant a tree for every piece of indoor wooden furniture we sell. Company-wide we ll meet our      responsibly sourced cotton and     responsibly source wood goals and grow our selection of sustainably made products. Most exciting is our upcoming announcement of an ambitious public goal for carbon reduction across our operations and throughout our entire supply chain.,0.20477399698575027,NEUTRAL
Diversity  equity inclusion is also essential to who we are as a company.

In addition to these COVID-related benefits  we also enhanced our parental leave policy to provide more paid time off for both primary and secondary caregivers.

Looking ahead to      and beyond we are very optimistic about our runway for growth and profitability. But before I give our financial outlook  let me provide some insight into what we are currently seeing in our business. All of our brands are starting the year strong. We re seeing higher than expected e-commerce traffic and sales and continuing recovery in our retail comps. Our entertaining related categories such as Easter and Outdoor are driving very strong results for us giving us the confidence that this entertaining lifestyle trend will accelerate post-pandemic as people welcome friends and families back into their home.,0.2746216181840282,POSITIVE
Our B B business sales trends also continue to accelerate week after week. Growth in our global business is also building momentum driven by strong demand from our franchise partners and our e-commerce business in Canada. In addition  our merchandise margins continue to expand as we have substantially reduced promotions. We will continue to chase inventory and unfortunately we are experiencing additional delays due to COVID-related slowdowns  a firm shortage to the inclement February weather in the south and delays due to port congestion and a shipping container shortage. We are doing all that we can to expedite inventory flow for our customers  but our in-stock recovery is now most likely pushed to Q  and while this is a challenge it is also one related to our very strong demand.,0.035865290090441704,NEUTRAL
We expect the strong demand to continue through      and beyond based on a number of factors. First is the ongoing strength of our growth initiatives and our three key differentiators that will continue to set us apart from the competition and allow us to take market share. Second  it is the recovery in our retail traffic and the replenishment of our inventory levels as we move throughout the year and beyond that will drive additional growth. And third  it is the favorable macro trends that we believe will continue to benefit our business. These include high consumer confidence  a strong housing market  a continuing shift to e-commerce  the expected continuation of working from home hybrid work and the importance of sustainability and values to the customer.,0.1324855250713881,NEUTRAL
This gives us the confidence that we can deliver mid to high single digit revenue growth and operating margin expansion in     .

Thank you Laura and good afternoon everyone. I also want to begin by thanking all of our associates for their resilience and hard work over the past year as we navigated an extremely challenging environment for making operational changes at the onset of the pandemic. To preserve liquidity and maintain strong financial health to managing the impact of widespread store closures while continuing to pay our people to fulfilling higher than expected online volumes as we grappled with partial shipping caps and supply chain disruptions  we stayed relentlessly focused on taking care of all of our stakeholders  our associates  our customers  and our shareholders and it was this focus that enabled us to report record fourth quarter and fiscal year results today.,0.3638079243246466,POSITIVE
In the fourth quarter  net revenues reached approximately  .  billion with net comparable brand revenue growth of   .   and an even higher demand comp of nearly      which includes orders  placed but not yet filled in the quarter. E-commerce grew at a comp of   .   and our retail stores continue to improve sequentially ending the quarter with a negative comp of  .  . This outperformed our expectations given the substantial COVID restrictions that were in place throughout the quarter and the overall decline in national store traffic of over    .,0.1397468140348792,NEUTRAL

Moving down the income statement  gross margin expanded     basis points to   .   in the fourth quarter driven by another quarter of substantially higher merchandise margins and occupancy leverage. Higher merchandise margins resulted from significantly reduced promotional activity as we replaced site-wide promotions with relevant content across all of our brands. Occupancy leveraged     basis points in the quarter resulting from higher sales and relatively flat year-over-year occupancy dollars at approximately     million.,0.037446982925757766,NEUTRAL
Our efforts to renegotiate rent and to close less profitable stores have enabled us to minimize our occupancy dollar growth and to deliver this occupancy leverage. While we did incur higher shipping costs year-over-year from a higher mix of e-commerce sales and peak shipping surcharges from our third-party shippers we are pleased to see our selling margins  which include these higher shipping costs sequentially improve again this quarter expanding     basis points year-over-year and     basis points from the third quarter.,0.12730642326641828,NEUTRAL
SG A in the fourth quarter was   .   of net revenues compared to   .   last year leveraging     basis points year-over-year and sequentially improving    basis points as a rate from the third quarter. SG A dollars grew   .   compared to last year primarily driven by higher employment costs from increased incentive compensation given our fiscal year outperformance  higher hourly variable pay particularly in our supply chain as our teams work to fulfill higher than expected volumes during the quarter and incremental pandemic related costs such as bonuses for our frontline workers  work from home stipends for our corporate associates and increased levels of PPE and cleanings across our facilities.,0.021267035510390997,NEUTRAL
Despite these incremental costs we were able to maintain a low SG A rate due to the strength of our sales volume and our overall strong financial discipline which kept SG A growth substantially below sales growth. As a result we delivered another quarter of record profitability with operating income growth of     to     million in operating margin expansion of     basis points to   .  . This resulted in diluted earnings per share of   .   or     higher than that of      at   .  .

In our cross brand loyalty program the key  we enrolled nearly   million customers bringing our total membership to almost    million members or     over      and our complimentary design crew services accounted for almost     of our fiscal year    in-store revenue. This top-line performance along with our strong financial discipline all year enabled us to generate operating income of over     million which was over     higher than     . This resulted in record operating margin expansion of     basis points to   .   and EPS of   .   almost double that of     .

Now let me turn to our expectations for the year ahead and beyond. Given the ongoing strength of our business as we enter       the expected recovery in our retail business and inventory levels as we move throughout the year as well as the macro trends that will continue to benefit our business  we expect      to be in line with our previously provided long-term financial outlook of mid to high single-digit revenue growth or    to    and year-over-year operating margin expansion. As far as our capital allocation in      we plan to first invest in the business and then return except cash to our shareholders. We expect to invest approximately     million to     million of business with over     of the capital spend prioritized on technology and supply chain initiatives that primarily support our e-commerce growth.,0.08427738351747394,NEUTRAL
In technology  we are focused on enhancing customer engagement and conversion online and in the supply chain we are planning to spend primarily on the addition of two new distribution centers to provide an incremental two million square feet in DC capacity to support our elevated growth as well as various investments in automation to drive speed and efficiency throughout our operations. As the consumer and our business continue to shift more online so have our levels of e-commerce related capital spend. Over the last five years alone  we have shifted from less than     e-commerce related spend to now over     of our estimated spend in      and we expect this shift to hold at these levels going forward.,0.011225429945625365,NEUTRAL
We also plan to return excess cash to our shareholders in the form of increased quarterly dividend payouts and increased levels of share repurchases following the     quarterly dividend increase that went into effect last quarter  we announced earlier today another double-digit increase in our quarterly dividend of   .   or   .   to   .   per share. As far as sharing purchases we plan to increase our level of repurchases over last year. Today we also announced that our board has approved a new billion dollar share repurchase program which will supersede the remaining outstanding under our prior authorization.,0.03037025296362117,NEUTRAL
While our staff is hovering around all-time highs we continue to believe that it remains undervalued given our projections for growth and profitability. As a result we believe investing in our own stock will also drive long-term financial returns. And finally  given our strong liquidity position and our expectations for another year of robust operating cash flow generation we paid off our      million term loan early and expect to let our      million     day line of credit facility naturally expire in May     . All of these decisions reflect our confidence in the long-term growth and profitability outlook of our company and our unwavering commitment to maximizing returns for our shareholders.,0.06225213367724791,NEUTRAL
Longer term as Laura mentioned  given the acceleration in our business along with the macro trends that should continue to favor our business for the long term we see a faster path to now reach    billion in net revenues and     operating margins in the next five years. We estimate that Pottery Barn will expand almost  .  billion in revenues. West Elm will grow double digits almost doubling in size to over   billion. Williams-Sonoma will reach almost  .  billion in revenues and our Pottery Barn kids and teen business will grow to  .  billion. This anticipated top-line growth in addition to strong growth in our core business will be fueled by accelerated double-digit growth across a number of our key initiatives including our B B business expanding to a billion in revenues  our marketplace business growing to almost three times the size of today to over     million  our emerging brands expanding to a combined revenue of over     million and our global operations more than doubling in size to     million.,0.12117940571624786,NEUTRAL
From a profitability perspective  further operating margin expansion should predominantly be driven by overall sales leverage from higher sales levels and a continued shift to our more efficient and profitable e-commerce business  reduced occupancy costs from the renegotiation of our lease agreements and the expected closure of approximately     of our retail fleet as our leases come up for renewal  continued strength in our product margins from an ongoing focus on more content-led marketing and more value-engineered high-quality and sustainable products as well as overall strong financial discipline maintaining expense growth below sales growth.,0.01736919832183048,NEUTRAL
In summary  our record performance this year is a testament to the strength of our teams and the power of our three key differentiators  our in-house design  our digital first channel strategy  and our values. As we look at the next year and beyond we are optimistic about our business and given the favorable long-term macro trends including a strong housing market  the disruption of brick and mortar  and an accelerating shift to e-commerce  the expected continuation of working from home in some capacity post-pandemic  and the increasing importance of sustainability and being a values driven company combined with our key differentiators  our growth initiatives  our double-digit growth and new customer accounts and loyalty members  our strong operating cash flow and liquidity  and a proven track record of strong financial discipline  we believe we are uniquely positioned to drive long-term growth and profitability resulting in market share gains and strong financial returns for our shareholders.,0.14416904425888788,NEUTRAL

Good afternoon. Congratulations. I mean  it really is a nice topping to what was a difficult year  but you made it through extraordinarily well. Laura  so my first question is for you. It looks like the brands are all hitting sort of this accelerated sweet spot of growth here in the U.S. Can you talk a little bit about the foreign businesses  You haven t yet stepped into Europe and so we re seeing some players in the space obviously launch into Europe kind of as their next phase of kind of TAM growth.,0.4851012561121024,POSITIVE
So can you talk about that first and foremost  And then Julie  really interesting on the occupancy line. I mean that is it s pretty incredible that your sales grew     and your occupancy is flat. So I really wanted to understand what the occupancy line trajectory looks like for     . Should we assume it s kind of flattish as we go through Q  and then into the full year  And then on the flip side of that on the merch margins are you at historically low levels of clearance and have you permanently changed the nature of the business such that we won t go back  we won t mean revert back to historical levels of promo  Thank you so much.

Thank you. In terms of global we recognized as we travel the world that no one else is doing what we re doing and we ve had great success in really bringing e-commerce to some of these markets particularly the franchise partners who are very well established  but didn t have a big e-commerce business and so we have  we partnered with great people in the Middle East. We have a really sizable operation. In fact this week we just opened a brand new flagship store in Dubai that is phenomenal with a Williams-Sonoma Home Expression that is something you haven t ever seen before. Two days in we re off to a great start there and that s just yet one example of the great stores that we re building together and the business we re building together with our franchise partners around the world. There is still a lot of growth there.,0.46168975421460345,POSITIVE
West Elm is one that hasn t been as established in these franchise markets and then also e-commerce continues to be a higher percent of sales in these global markets. We announced last year that we d be going into India. We are still on track to do that. It s a little delayed  but it s a big market. Our forecast is that it s one of the most sizeable for us and we re very excited about that partnership. We want to do it really well and so we put off China and we don t have plans to enter China at this point. Similarly  we are in London with West Elm. We have some things in some of the department stores there. We also have kids  website  but we don t have further plans to expand other than in e-commerce. It s just there is a lot more easy places to go right now than Europe with a long leases and also just the difficulty of doing business there.

So regarding occupancy and your questions there so I think first of all if you look back you ll see that we have been holding occupancy dollar growth down for a while now and we do expect that to continue. The important thing to remember is there is many things that go into occupancy like depreciation from capital investments  also our distribution center rent. So there will be ups and downs but the reality is as I said in my prepared remarks if we re closing apparently about     of our fleet at least that will lower our occupancy dollars and then potentially be offset by these other things that I just mentioned but then you combine that with the higher sales volume  higher e-commerce volume and all of that leverages that line. So I do expect both to have more muted dollar growth but also the higher sales will drive that leverage going forward for the foreseeable future.,-0.0583523977547884,NEUTRAL
As far as merchandise margins  yes  we do have some of the lowest levels of clearance inventory that we ve had in the company and at this point in time we expect that to continue but it s also the fact that we ve made a decision to really pull off of site-wide promos and go after content-led relevant marketing. So instead of just doing a blanket email where we give you     off we re getting more and more fine-tuned about what we serve up to you to give you what you want and if you want it you could only get it from us and that combined with the fact that we are value engineering the product to get at the right price and the right quality and the right sustainability levels and we ll never compromise on that. It puts it in a situation where if you want it you got to buy it it s a great price so people are buying it.

Sorry about that. Good evening. I just want to follow up on the selling margin or merchandise marketing commentary you provided during the call. I think you said  selling margins expanded     basis points during the fourth quarter. So can you remind us what that number was for the year and then as we think about the path to a     EBIT margin  any commentary on the cadence of the selling margin profile in the business as you think about potentially cycling something  some of these transitory headwinds whether it be clearance as you just mentioned or promotional activity. Do you see anything as it relates to cadence in the selling margin ,-0.23243658896535635,NEUTRAL
Laura Alber,0.002334314282052219,NEUTRAL
I mean  selling margins all year have been accelerating on from an improvement standpoint from an expansion standpoint. So again  we expect that to continue going forward. I don t have handy right now the exact amount on the year  but if you look back you can see by quarter that they ve continued to expand and this quarter in particular was the largest expansion. As far as puts and takes as to what could drive the selling margins I mean we ve always said that the shipping costs are a part of selling margins and so that obviously has become something that we ve been focused on more recently especially as our mix shift to e-commerce  the more furniture we have and there s been higher rates that have come through with our third-party shippers. But I think the combination of the fact that we can drive these merch-margin expansion throughout and then you layer it with occupancy on top of it is what s been able to give us this incredible gross margin expansion for the entire year and so that is why we re confident going forward that ll continue.,-0.11495760083198547,NEUTRAL
We obviously also are working specifically on shipping costs and trying to minimize those increases as much as possible to help with the selling margins going forward in addition to the merch-margin and whether that s using more of our omni fulfillment at our stores which has been a huge win for us obviously during this time and it s a differentiator the fact that we have these stores as hubs around the country to obviously trying to figure out ways to take this larger items and bring it into our own delivery network and lowering some of the cost with our third-party shippers. Now at the same time we have great relationships with our third-party shippers and so we re working with them to come to a great solution but we are focused not only on offsetting shipping costs but also lowering them in an absolute sense to keep driving these selling margins to where they are.,-0.013758927583694458,NEUTRAL

Yes. Thanks guys. I had a question regarding labor costs. You mentioned COVID pay in       but then also bonuses and all of that. So I wanted to see how you plan for      and beyond for on labor costs ,0.37027025036513805,POSITIVE
Julie Whalen,0.0013350994267966598,NEUTRAL
So our labor costs as we spoke to during the year have obviously gone up. You ve heard that from many other retailers especially the hourly rates and so across the board we have moved to a     per hour rate. So at least we re at     per hour or even higher in our distribution centers in particular in certain areas. And so we ve got a lot of that in our base. Obviously there s always pressure and we always look at the hourly wages on a market by market basis and we want to be competitive.,-0.062376976013183594,NEUTRAL
Our people have been the secret sauce if you will especially this year and so we are making certain that we re taking care of them from an hourly rate perspective but since we ve made these moves in the past it s not as much of a headwind for us as it might be for others. On the flip side I think you mentioned COVID costs. We obviously expect that there will be reduced or eliminated COVID cost which is going to help us next year because those are fairly substantial and so you ve got some moving parts.,0.01119336485862732,MIXED
Labor you ve got the utilization with these hourly wages and potential a little more pressure on the labor line. You ve got the fact that we may have some more advertising spend but on the flip side you ve got COVID costs that are coming out. So it gives us a lot of confidence combined with our merchandise margin expansion and our occupancy leverage and with higher sales leveraging the entire P L that we can drive operating margin expansion next year.,0.00867258757352829,NEUTRAL

Thanks a lot and good evening. Congrats on a great quarter and year. My question is around the outlook  very impressive in terms of the margin outlook particularly for     . Just perhaps you provide a little bit more color on the complexion of the margin expansion you re expecting in       how much of it will be in gross margin  How much of it in SG A  you expect both of those to provide expansion to your operating margins ,0.48636992555111647,POSITIVE
Julie Whalen,0.0013350994267966598,NEUTRAL
Yes. This is Julie. I will answer that question. So we expect expansion on both. It s obviously going to depend by quarter and we re not giving quarterly line item guidance but at the end of the day we re very confident in our merchandise margin expansion. We re very confident in our occupancy leverage and as I just mentioned on the last question that we have  I guess  benefit of some of these COVID costs that are going to be flipping out and yes  we will have some increased costs but we will be able to more than cover that as a result of the higher COVID cost that will be coming out to cover it.,0.17477596830576658,NEUTRAL
And so that combined with higher sales will allow us to leverage any of those costs that are coming through and drive operating margin expansion on the bottom line. And remember a lot of the sales that we re driving now with an expectation of     or higher are going to be e-commerce and e-commerce we have historically been one of the most profitable e-commerce companies out there and so as we shift more and more to e-commerce that completely leverages the P L.

Hi and congratulations also on a good quarter. I had two questions. One when you look at your demand trends  are they prior based or are you seeing any notable differences in markets that where restrictions have been lifted or have higher vaccination rates versus those that don t  So that s one and then my second question is on fulfillment. I wanted to see if you could talk more about the ship from store and how you can roll that further and help perhaps lower some of your cost to fulfill the orders and how do you see that evolving over the next couple years ,0.4273898405954242,POSITIVE
Laura Alber,0.002334314282052219,NEUTRAL
Yes. So thank you this is Laura. Let me just first take the ship from store and then I m going to pass it to Felix to answer what we re seeing or not seeing with the correlations. So in terms of ship from store  ship from store is great because it leverages inventory that would otherwise be trapped in stores and helps us better fulfill customers demand and we re getting better and better at it and driving it and marketing it correctly putting on filters to our sites they can sort for things and it s an area that has grown up a ton more this year  but there is still a lot more room for us to do more with that and in particular with bylines pick up in store.,0.44246940407902,POSITIVE
So we ve been pushing that as well not just because it s COVID but because it s another great way to service the customer who wants to get in and out quickly. So you re going to see us continue to market them better  have better site experiences and put more power behind infrastructure. I m going to pass it to Felix what we re seeing with vaccination and face opening and all that good stuff.,0.1053198054432869,POSITIVE
Felix Carbullido,-0.03713781596161425,NEUTRAL
Sure. Thanks for the question. What we ve seen in our data is that demand for furniture is still very strong in states where vaccination rates are high. So there s no correlation between changes in state level that vaccination rates and our data and our growth in our furniture business. So what we re seeing is it s really not a zero-sum game here. As more people get vaccinated  as travel starts to open up  as schools start to open up  we have a substantial gear business  a luggage business and as vaccination rates increase we expect people to open up their homes more. So our dining and entertaining businesses are primed for that. So early indications are no correlation in fact it s a negative correlation is what we re seeing. We re seeing strong rates across the board regardless of vaccination rates.,-0.038874879479408264,NEUTRAL

Hi guys great quarter. Thanks for taking my questions. My first one was just on the Williams-Sonoma concept another remarkable quarter there. Curious what you re seeing as far as repeat spending trends now that we re beginning to anniversary some of these cook and eat at home trends from last year. Any color there as far as kind of new and repeat customers would be helpful  That was my first question.,0.4792202009120956,POSITIVE
Laura Alber,0.002334314282052219,NEUTRAL
Sure. First I ll say that yes Williams-Sonoma we ve made a lot of changes to that strategy and it s paying off from the exclusive to shifting from what was predominantly a store business to an online business and really driving content again which we re thrilled to continue to do. In terms of the Williams-Sonoma categories that are working we are seeing great strength across the board particularly the areas where most dominant cookware  cutlery  electrics.,0.42503989167744294,POSITIVE
In terms of customer metrics we have very favorable customer metrics and it s interesting we have very high orders per customer versus last year repeat customers and when you compare it to someone like a wayfarer and you see that we have higher dollars in all those categories strictly higher dollars per order we have extremely productive online advertising and online profitability as Julie mentioned earlier.

No  I mean just to reiterate we haven t  we ve seen our repeat rates be very strong and as Laura mentioned all those new customers we acquired during shelter and place are returning at record rates and actually shopping across our portfolios at record rates. So we think that our share of wallet within these new customers will continue to grow as we introduce them to not just the best of Williams-Sonoma  but what our other brands have to offer in leveraging our loyalty program to encourage them to shop across our portfolio.,0.09522719867527485,NEUTRAL

Design crew I think you mentioned around half of in-store revenues and I think you mentioned those customers are spending around two times as much.

I thought you were going to ask a different question  I was ready for the other one which is I wanted to tell you that one of the most amazing things that happened during the shutdown is that the people who worked in store who couldn t work did virtual design chat and they have done such a phenomenal job that it s a whole new channel for us now. So we have the online design services where you don t need to do anything but use our tools. In fact you can power yourself the  D tour tool  which nobody has done that before.

Congratulations guys. Amazing quarter  amazing year and I love the way the stores look right now. Your transition spring has been beautiful. So Laura and Julie I guess kind of a bigger picture question here to start the home space has become very popular getting a little bit more crowded online. So you outlined some of your key differentiators. Would that also fit into like what are your differentiators online  What are your advantages that you have on e-commerce that differentiates you and separates you from the pack as it gets more crowded ,0.4952899676281959,POSITIVE
Laura Alber,0.002334314282052219,NEUTRAL
Great question Marni. Thank you. So online  we really bring not just a single product to life but a lifestyle and so we have spent a long time the PIP  the Product Information Page is the lifestyle. And everything that is on that page needs to help you make that decision whether it s  D or UGC  which we have really amped up online and then different guided shopping paths if you re interested in something and we re seeing that really help us add on to an order if you went on to look for one thing to be able to show you and have you add something else and inspire you to buy things you didn t think you were looking for and versus our competition. There is a lot of people selling many things but sometimes it s about really helping the customer make a decision and if they trust you with your quality and your sustainability and your value equation the conversion is higher.,0.4205723551567644,POSITIVE
So we know that the work that we ve done to build the brand actually through our stores in a lot of cases and through our catalogs is now coming to fruition online and so we continue to make the investments in the things that make it easier for the customer to make a decision whether that s swatches  color accuracy   D modeling in rooms  immersive experiences and just simply real-life photography showing people how other customers have used something really makes a difference. I d say the other thing that s really different about us is that with all these different brands run by separate people such a wealth of ideas and innovation and we can try something in one brand and then not bet the farm and push it across multiple brands once we know it works  and Elisa s team is very innovative in looking at AB testing and always trying something new and that s been a big part of our success with our key tech partners.,0.06869242340326309,NEUTRAL

The trends that you are seeing that emerged during COVID  which one do you think will be stickiest post-pandemic and also it sounds like in spite of the enormous growth online and all your work online  it sounds like in every turn you are still talking about the stores and it sounds like that s still important part of the story. Is that how you are thinking going forward ,0.08074706792831421,MIXED
Laura Alber,0.002334314282052219,NEUTRAL
Yes. Let s talk about the on trends that we see. When you think about  first of all  we are so excited that the back team is underway and we are still hopeful for reopening of the economy once we reached immunity. The hope has always been your biggest investment. Home values have gone up overtime historically for Americans. They invest in their home. They know that they usually get it back and this year it s the better piece. Everything you were there too much. And you learned a lot new things. And lot more  you know the people learned to cook. Once you learn to cook you never go back. You may go out for dinner  but you are going to cook better. And you are always going to be interested in the cooking trend. And that is key to the future of Williams-Sonoma.,0.3857633303850889,POSITIVE
I would say secondly  entertainment. We have been able to entertain. Some people like actually be able to get together for Easter  July   and imagine the holidays. We are busy dreaming of the most inspiring Christmas parties  New Year s parties that we can host in our homes and how we make that better for our customers and we cannot wait to serve our customers.,0.49105582501215395,POSITIVE
Also outdoor. We like fresh air. Nobody got this. Nobody even got the cold or the flu. I think you are going to stay outdoors a lot more than you did before. We are seeing as I mentioned strength in West Elm outdoor  well by the way it s equally  it s going to  Indiscernible  and Williams-Sonoma homes and if you haven t seen the new Williams-Sonoma home catalog  take a pick at that because it s dominant this way of luxury outdoor that I think you will be extremely inspired by.,0.3619331903755665,POSITIVE
The last picture and I just want to talk about obviously hybrid work from home. I don t know about you  but I still have a really accomplished the perfect work from home station. I still have desk to buy. You have been so busy you just don t get around. There is still a lot more room to make those work from home spaces better and new home builds are going to include it. So that s the business we are willing to play in and we have that work phase business in West Elm and we continue to grow it and we have a lot of guidance and innovation on work from home. So there is a lot of opportunities for us Marni and it s just whether it s product growth strategy or business to business or channel strategy  you take the gross strategy together and you put it with our three key differentiators and the macro I am telling we are going to have a great ride here and it s a multi-year ride.,0.3891326221637428,POSITIVE

Thanks  John  and good morning  everyone. I d like to start by thanking our employees for their hard work during a very difficult but very successful restructuring process. A year ago  Extraction had     employees. Today  we have    . With regret but out of necessity  we reduced our headcount by     in     . We miss those folks and we sincerely appreciate the hard work turned in by our current staff who picked up the slack as we emerged from Chapter    this past January.,0.4178128559142351,POSITIVE
Our restructuring process was difficult but it s also positioned us for success in the current environment. Our streamlined staffing has increased efficiency and collaboration even during the pandemic and contributed to a reduction in cash G A of nearly    . We equitized   .  billion in unsecured debt and preferred equity. We reduced our RBL borrowings from      million to the      million that s currently drawn under our revolver. We reduced our D C and LOE costs by over    . Our run rate  transportation and gathering expenses have declined by approximately     through the renegotiation of   of our key midstream and marketing contracts. And we eliminated the vast majority of our midstream minimum volume commitments as part of that same process.,0.22757144225761294,NEUTRAL
One thing that didn t change during the restructuring is the quality of our property base  both in terms of geology and concentration. Our year-end total proved PV-   value was   .  billion using March   strip pricing  and our PDP PV-   was just under   .  billion. And today  for the first time in a long time  we have a balance sheet that complements the value of our asset base  with a straightforward capital structure comprised of common equity and our borrowing base facility  leverage of less than   times EBITDA and more than      million in available liquidity.,0.09709211252629757,NEUTRAL
As a company  we now have a new  highly engaged Board of Directors  and we ve adopted a new business model  focused on returns over growth  low leverage  scale economics to be achieved through consolidation and the generation of material free cash flow. Specifically  with respect to our excess cash flow  we expect to fully repay our outstanding debt this year so we will be debt-free by year-end. And we hope to institute a dividend policy over the same time frame.,0.04983346560038626,NEUTRAL
From a governance perspective  we ve implemented a new compensation structure.

Thanks  Tom. By way of update  after ceasing drilling and completion operations back in the second quarter of       we still generated net sales volumes of        BOE per day in the fourth quarter of       of which was     liquids. This year  we recommenced operations with   drilling rig on our Wake North pad and   completion crew on our GP pad  both in Greeley. We are preparing the GP pad to be turned in line during the second quarter  and the Wake North pad should begin production around the beginning of the third quarter.,0.24857532791793346,POSITIVE
As Tom noted  we are prioritizing cash returns in all of our operations  and we expect to balance the allocation of our cash flow among reinvestment in our projects  debt reduction and distributions to shareholders. We have also made the strategic decision to up-space relative to our historical drilling strategies. We believe this is the optimal way to allocate capital and maximize returns through decreasing cycle times and improving per-well EURs.,0.10319327856996097,NEUTRAL
We have already begun this effort by completing    to    wells on the GP and Wake North pads  which were originally planned for    to    wells each.

Obviously  you have a plan to reduce debt to zero at the end of the year here  and you also talked about consolidation opportunities as well in the space. Certainly seems like the balance sheet is well positioned for that. I think in the press release  you did talk about some leasehold acquisitions. But wanted to see if there s any other kind of chunkier deals that you may have your eyes on out there  I know there are still some distressed private operators out there in the DJ.

Yes  Leo  it s Tom. How are you doing this morning  I d say   things. There is kind of a day-to-day optimization that we do in our assets  and those are largely cash transactions  whether they are sales of non-core assets or acquisitions of working interest to increase our ownership in our existing projects. And literally  we re considering those and executing those on a weekly basis. And then there are the strategic transactions. I would say at any one point in time  candidly  we re in dialogue with   or more parties about the possibility of transacting. And that  I would say that the majority of those are equity-based transactions. And I also don t think that the mode that we are in is materially different than the mode of others in the basin and others in the industry. So I would say it s a stated part of our strategy to consolidate and we re pursuing it aggressively.,0.09538553655147552,NEUTRAL

Okay. And then just maybe jumping over to kind of the existing operations here. Obviously  you talked about a plan to kind of up-space with wider spacing. And just wanted to kind of get a sense when you sort of look at kind of current permits in hand across the company and kind of given the up space. What can you kind of tell us about the existing inventory  even if it s just kind of a high level number or XOG things that got   or   years of running room or whatever the number might be  And then maybe to kind of add on that  what s the plan in terms of further negotiations with some of the local municipalities  And kind of where does that stand in terms of maybe adding new operator agreements or expanding existing ones on the acreage footprint ,-0.14097281359136105,NEUTRAL

Leo  this is Matt. You re right  we have really looked at our inventory with an up-spacing perspective  focusing on returns. We have some slides on that in our presentation that illustrates how we view it. But up-space count that the company has is that     locations  and that was based off of when we did our original guidance. But as you can tell from the Slide    in our deck  that obviously changes with commodity prices.,0.03652152232825756,NEUTRAL
But right now  we re comfortable with where the strip is at  that we have about     up-space locations remaining  which at our current rig pace and the fact that we drill mostly  -mile-or-longer wells would be about   years of inventory. And as far as the other municipal operator agreements go  we don t have any new ones that we re currently working on. There are some that will be in the pipe shortly but they re not anywhere near the size and scale of some of the ones that we ve executed in the past such as Commerce City or Broomfield with -- in terms of well counts. But we will continue adding small operator agreements to finish developing our acreage around the edges of some of those municipalities.,0.06343649700284004,MIXED

Just one housekeeping item. In the disclosure statement  I recall there being a pretty sizable working capital true-up that needed to be paid this year and in the     -plus million range. And I saw your free cash flow guidance slide looks quite robust and you re going to end the year with no net debt. Is that -- was that working capital  which I thought was -- maybe some chunk of it was by the tax payments  Has that been kicked to a future year or was it overestimated  Or what exactly is going on there ,0.15580607950687408,POSITIVE

Hey  Patrick  this is Marianella. Thanks for joining the call. I would say we -- that -- if you look at Page   in our presentation  we gave a      million working capital deficit. The year-end number  since we were still in bankruptcy as of year-end  is a little bit noisy. We do have  to your point  fairly large tax statements that we have made and will continue to make through April. Come April  there will be a more normal course working capital deficit.,0.06395938992500305,NEUTRAL
If you look at Page    we have made and we ll continue to make payments and working capital will tighten by about     million.

Patrick Sheffield,0.00047093656758079305,NEUTRAL

Marianella Foschi,0.00047763872862560675,NEUTRAL
Absolutely. It s all in. And we merged with -- that there was about   chunks of production taxes we made in January  February  March. The   in April is just a normal course annual tax payment. So really  the delinquent property taxes that we did not pay before bankruptcy were all paid through this month. And in April  we ll have another large bill. But like I said  that s equivalent to much higher commodity price and much higher production than we saw in     . And so once April is behind us  you ll see that more normal course. But yes  the free cash flow guidance is all in after working capital payments.,-0.22686506807804108,NEGATIVE

Jeffrey Robertson,0.00023411650181515142,NEUTRAL
A question. Tom  can you talk philosophically about the reinvestment rate that you plan for the business in the context of dividend and generating free cash flow out into      ,0.04032672010362148,NEUTRAL
Thomas Tyree,0.0005752397555625066,NEUTRAL
Sure. How are you doing  Jeff  Thanks for the question. First of all  I don t think we consider ourselves beholden to any set percent of cash flow going in any   direction  other than to say that we want to direct our cash flow every year to reinvestment in our projects  to debt repayment and to shareholder distributions. Those latter    I think the choice will become much more current for us towards the end of the year  certainly second half of the year  probably the fourth quarter after we are in a position where we ve paid down most of our debt.,-0.025617565959692,NEUTRAL
And what we re weighing is distributions to shareholders versus reinvestment. Any given quarter  the things that factor into it are economic inventory and commodity prices and our dividend policy  which is yet to be determined. But we are -- I think we are set on imposing on ourselves a distribution policy that deals with  on the   hand  delevering  and on the other hand  returning cash to our shareholders and doing that on a continuous basis once we get our leverage down a little bit further. Does that answer your question ,-0.03577781422063708,NEUTRAL
Jeffrey Robertson,0.00023411650181515142,NEUTRAL
Yes. I guess what is part of what you re saying that you re going to instill discipline in the capital allocation process by how much you reinvest versus how much you potentially have for distributions ,-0.015233896672725677,NEUTRAL
Thomas Tyree,0.0005752397555625066,NEUTRAL
Well  first of all  I would say our capital allocation process is already pretty darn disciplined. We ve got a Board and a management team that are very  very focused on making sure that any investment we make in any of our projects is highly economic and is accretive to our return on capital employed on a corporate basis.,0.3604069158900529,POSITIVE
But I think the question you may be getting at is  when we sit around on a quarterly basis and decide how we re going to allocate capital  we are very rigorously going to look at the benefit of distributing cash to shareholders as an alternative. And that probably is different than past practices. I d also say that it s hard to envision a scenario  even with commodity prices very high  where we would not allocate a material percentage of our cash flow to shareholder distributions or debt repayment  if it happens to be this year.,-0.09590859012678266,NEUTRAL

A question  if I can follow up  maybe for Matt. On Slide     where you talk about the de-spacing  I think you said  Matt  that the current numbers are based on strip pricing. I m just curious  how does the changes in prices and changes in costs  how does it affect the ideal spacing for your development ,-0.00822931039147079,NEUTRAL
Matthew Owens,0.00034293284988962114,NEUTRAL
Yes  you re correct. Page    is illustrative of how we kind of are looking at each development area in our inventory. Obviously  we re not going to make real-time changes based on weekly moves in the commodity price  but we re going to be more focused on what it looks like    to    months down the road. But if there is a long-term uplift in the strip or it s not backwardated as much  that could shift us to the right slightly on this plot on Page   .,-0.09737920016050339,MIXED
But really  the main goal we re going for here is not necessarily maximizing our net present value  it s really maximizing the return on each incremental dollar we invest in the ground. So how much more CapEx or how much more NPV are we getting  net present value are we getting for each capital dollar that we re putting in the ground. And on this particular example that we re showing here  the limit is  in our minds  right around   .,0.05519833602011204,NEUTRAL

Jeff just asked my question about the spacing. A little more elaboration. It sounds like it was driven by incremental well economics as opposed to whatever was driving it in the past. Appears that other basin operators are doing similar things. How much does the spacing approach vary among your   or   large areas  How dispersed is the quality of your regional areas ,-0.03828815370798111,NEUTRAL

Dave  thanks for the question. It does vary. On that same slide  there     you ll see in the first bullet point  we mentioned it s anywhere between   and    wells per section. And that really covers our acreage position in the core from the northern end in Windsor all the way down to the southern end in Hawkeye. For example  the lower end of that scale would be the acreage that we have in the Hawkeye Area. And the main reason for that is just the amount of formations there.,0.3010026696138084,POSITIVE
So in Hawkeye  if you remember  the Codell formation is not present. It s a Niobrara only. So down there  we are looking at about   wells per section in the Niobrara. As you move north and you get into Broomfield  North Hawkeye  you get into Greeley  we have the Niobrara and the Codell formation there  so they both play in. And right now  the best economics that the company has is really the remaining pads we have in the Greeley area  and those will be the ones tipping the scale towards the upper end  around    wells per section.,0.050322216004133224,NEUTRAL

Matthew Owens,0.00034293284988962114,NEUTRAL
That s a good question. So when we first purchased the asset a couple of years ago  you re correct  there was very little midstream infrastructure down in the area  particularly for the gas processing  and there s actually no oil infrastructure in place at that time. Over the last couple of years  a large public company drilled some more wells down in that area  spread out across their position. It s since been purchased by a private operator who has continued the development.,0.07974262908101082,NEUTRAL
But they have continued to expand their gathering infrastructure with respect to gas  and it covers most of their position  which is really the Western flank of our position. And we re not too far from the gathering infrastructure for the pads that we want to drill in the next few years. And then there s also an oil midstream company who has come down and started laying gathering lines. So while it s not as built out and robust as it is up in the Wattenberg Field  there is continuous expansion going on  both with the gas gathering and the oil gathering down in that area.,-0.0048705581575632095,MIXED
