Jan Medina,-0.0013248022878542542
Thanks  Liz  and thank you all for joining us today. Today s call is being webcast and we will be available on our website for replay. Before we start  I just want to quickly introduce myself. I know  I ve spoken with a number of you already over the last month or so  but I started here at Agenus back in February. I would help lead the Investor Relations efforts. Certainly  it s a very promising time for the company. I m looking forward to being part of the conversations we re having with the investment community.,0.4862594042206183
With that said  I just want to remind you that this call will include forward-looking statements  including statements regarding our clinical development  regulatory and commercial plans and time lines  as well as time lines for data release and partnership opportunities. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and we refer you to our SEC filings for more details on these risks. As a reminder  this call is being recorded for audio broadcast.,-0.00325805286411196
Joining me today are Dr. Garo Armen  Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  Dr. Jennifer Buell  President and Chief Operating Officer  Andy Hurley  Chief Commercial Officer  and Christine Klaskin  Vice President of Finance.,0.0238877049414441
Also available during the question-and-answer session will be Dr. Steven O Day our Chief Medical Officer. Dr. O Day joined Agenus earlier this year as well  along with a number of other key hires and brings clinical development expertise to Agenus at this pivotal time.,0.016549952459172346
Now  I ll turn the call over to Garo to highlight our key accomplishments and our goals for     . Garo ,0.0704051605425775
Garo Armen,-0.023363035870715976
Good morning. Thank you very much. In       our pipeline continued to grow with an arsenal of agents designed to activate the immune system across different types of patients and cancers on one hand  while also addressing immunotherapy resistance pathways across many tumor types and the other.,0.4761974765569903
We expect these advances will contribute to the I-O field on multiple fronts. For instance  we are advancing AGEN     s clinical development and generating responses in patients who are unlikely to otherwise respond to immunotherapy.,0.019017105572856963
We expect to advance AGEN     to registrational studies this year. We ve also made substantial advances with our TIGIT programs  demonstrating the unique attributes of our bispecific antibody  which is IND-ready.,0.1305794392246753
One of our notable achievements during      was the completion of patient enrollment and data analysis of our two most clinically advanced agents  balstilimab  which is our PD-  antibody  and zalifrelimab  which is our first-generation CTLA-  antibody. We call these bal and zal for short.,0.4017303410801105
We are progressing with the completion of our BLA filing for bal and will proceed with our strategy regarding the potential bal plus zal filing  once bal s BLA filing has been accepted. It is our aim to use balstilimab as the foundation for several of our pipeline agents as well as offer our bal for use with therapies from other companies  which require combination with a PD-  blocker. Our objective is to rapidly enable synergistic combinations to advance the field.,0.041758889907214325
Synergistic combinations for our agents include cell therapies through our subsidiary AgenTus. While we are continuing our allogeneic intelligent iNKT cell therapy in patients with COVID-    we will be advancing these intelligent cells into cancer trials with combinations around mid-year.,0.006147445055830758
Separately  at a time when the world s need for higher quantities of vaccine production grows  we are advancing our plans for producing high quantities of QS-   adjuvant from a renewable source.,0.031314609688706696
QS-   is an antigen-sparing adjuvant. What that means is that a vaccine formulation with QS-   may require as little as    -fold less antigen to achieve the same immune response.,0.0418863482773304
If this proves to be the case for some or most COVID-   vaccines  you can appreciate the potential implications of QS-   to be able to significantly increase global COVID-   manufacturing capacity -- that is vaccine manufacturing capacity without the need to add additional antigen production capabilities which is one of the major bottlenecks of today.,-0.05109625309705734
Several of these advancements I touched upon represent important milestones. We expect some of those to result in cash accretive corporate transactions starting in the second quarter of this year.,0.039205170003697276
In       we built on Agenus  foundation of innovation and integration. These are -- that is innovation and integration  are the key pillars of our business model. While COVID has posed challenges for many  including Agenus  we were early to anticipate and adjust to life in the very early stages of the pandemic.,0.027864934629178606
We ve also rapidly adjusted to address new needs such as iNKT cell therapy in patients with more severe infections of COVID-   who are dependent on life support. We published early data from the trial and expect to share more as our trial matures. Our teams are also preparing for the scenario of a rapid or emergency use path for iNKT cell therapy should the trial data look encouraging.,0.058069097402039915
But with all these adjustments  our whole mission is unchanged. We will continue to innovate and advance our programs with speed. This requires integrated capabilities to reduce our dependence on outsiders on one hand  but also very importantly retaining and continuing to acquire high talent.,0.11896512855309993
High talent density is key to our ability to deliver innovation. Recently  we welcomed stunning talent into our leadership team  and I will start with Dr. Steven O Day  our Chief Medical Officer  and our Chief Commercial Officer  Andy Hurley. These two professionals are among some of the most respected names in the field.,0.4281841449846979
Dr. O Day is a pioneer in immuno-oncology  and as a clinical investigator he has been an important contributor to the success we ve seen so far with AGEN    . As we advance in the discovery and development of high-performing immune therapies and particularly combinations  we need to have formidable players like Dr. O Day on our team.,0.3458717185858404
Dr. O Day played a key role in the successful development of Yervoy and Opdivo CTLA-  and PD-  agents as well as several other cancer therapies. He has the knowledge and expertise to build on our work with      cemented in place in the IO landscape and fully maximize the compound s potential as a blockbuster therapy for cancer patients.,0.1597560756126768
We have big plans for AGEN      and we ll pursue accelerated pathways to advance the molecule to the market. Andy Hurley will be a key driver of our aspirations to do this. In his role as Chief Commercial Officer  Andy joined us after three decades of building teams and commercializing product in biopharma. With the balstilimab BLA filing expected in the first half of this year  Andy will help establish Agenus as a commercial company with balstilimab as a key actor in our plans for our ambitious combination strategies.,0.108061164180981
Given our mission to develop impactful combinations for patients  Agenus requires clinical scientists with extensive and established expertise. Dr. Joe Grossman joined our team as Head of Exploratory Medicine from Harvard and Beth Israel. His specialty includes colorectal and pancreatic cancers. Dr. Grossman will drive our translational medicine strategy  which is a key aspect of Agenus  clinical development strategy.,0.07851540853516781
Dr. Jason Paragas  another recent addition to our team is an expert in data analysis and artificial intelligence. He formerly served with DARPA  working on threat detection for the U.S. government and associated defense departments. Jason joined us as Vice President of Strategic Initiatives. Jason will also be working with our team to industrialize and broaden the applications of our VISION response prediction technology. Next  Adam Krauss joined as Chief Legal and Compliance Officer to ensure our commercial readiness  and Marc Wiles joined as Vice President of Regulatory Affairs.,0.04876433609024389
It is a transformative period for Agenus and the value each of these team members bring will help drive a new level of success for the company. We understand the ambitious scale of our mission as we seek to disrupt an industry that has been challenged with disruptive demands. We believe marshalling the best people and resources is paramount to achieving success.,0.23875871545897098
I would now like to turn the call over to our President and Chief Operating Officer  Dr. Jennifer Buell.,0.06103072315454483
Jennifer Buell,0.0014714345597894862
Thank you Garo. As Garo indicated  our R D engine has been enormously productive with numerous discoveries  IND filings  and product candidates advancing in late-stage trials. As a result       was a period of significant data flow. We presented data updates on our programs at all of the leading oncology conferences last year. At SITC  AACR and ASCO  we presented data on clinical responses with       as well as the differentiation of our five lead molecules. And finally  we also presented data on our response predictive -- prediction platform VISION.,0.3164578736468684
With our TIGIT bispecific  AGEN      we presented data revealing the potential to broaden the activity beyond first generation of anti-TIGIT antibodies. We ve engineered an important region of the molecule the Fc region to improve responses  expand the population of responders  and generate monotherapy activity  which is not currently seen with TIGIT monospecific antibodies available today.,0.0145679691049736
More recently at ESMO just a few months ago  we presented preliminary data from the balstilimab monotherapy and bal zal combination studies  showing breakthrough activity in PD-L  positive and PD-L  negative cervical cancer patients. As we look into      including AACR next month  we will continue our aggressive approach to data presentation  providing clinical updates on our lead compounds including AGEN    .,0.015482909977436066
On our BLA filings  our rolling BLA filing for balstilimab monotherapy in second-line cervical cancer is underway. Initiated in September  we expect to complete the filing during the first half of this year. And as we disclosed in September  this timeline accommodates two additional late confirmed responders seen in our pivotal trial. We ll provide the FDA with six months of follow-up on those patients  as well as   -month median follow-up on all trial participants. We believe balstilimab s approval would represent a meaningful new option for the cervical cancer community.,0.01845350582152605
We note that pembrolizumab  KEYTRUDA is approved in the PD-L  positive population only and shows no clinical responses in PD-L  negative tumors. And in the largest IO clinical trial in this population to date in over     patients treated with balstilimab alone  we reported response rates of     in PD-L  positive patients and     in PD-L  negative patients. This compares favorably to KEYTRUDA  which has     responses in PD-L  positive tumors and no responses in PD-L  negative tumors.,0.008021618472412229
In addition  the durability of response in our pivotal trial was impressive  lasting approximately   .  months. This is not observed with chemotherapeutic options currently available for these patients.,0.4347612224519253
The duration of response is a hallmark of effective IO agents and ours far exceeds the limited duration of response  observed with chemotherapy for these patients. We believe  these clinical data  reveal emerging differential features of balstilimab.,0.053943592065479606
We plan to publish the full clinical data set of balstilimab  in refractory cervical cancer in a high-profile journal. Additionally  we will publish pre-clinical data from our vision platform  that further elucidates  bal s superior  tumor cell killing capabilities  compared to the leading commercially available PD-  antibodies.,0.023304452566662803
Regarding our plans for the balstilimab plus zalifrelimab BLA filing  we ve been in ongoing discussions with the FDA. The trial has completed enrollment. The patients have concluded the median of    months of follow-up. And we re collecting data  on late responses  in this trial as well.,0.03805197891779244
The data continues to improve as it matures  with response rates and most importantly  duration of those responses. Agenus will continue to keep the agency informed of additional data advancements. And as Garo just discussed  we plan to disclose the timing and strategy regarding bal  and zal  once bal s FDA filing has been accepted.,0.03977417730493471
Our first approval with balstilimab would mark a strategic milestone for Agenus. Having our own approved PD-  inhibitor would allow us the freedom and flexibility  for the development and commercial pricing of our combination regimens  with our own IO compounds  including CTLA-   TIGIT and novel molecules targeting myeloid pathways and beyond.,0.07550428347894922
In addition  we see a significant opportunity with our PD-   in combination with potential partnered programs. Regarding       to the emerging clinical profile of       again this is also an engineered antibody.,0.1342188428970985
We ve engineered the Fc region of the antibody  to improve its features. We designed       for superior efficacy with improved T cell priming and the capability to deplete  suppressive intra-tumoral regulatory T cells.,0.169904159498401
We ve also designed the molecule for better safety  avoiding complement-mediated toxicities and to broaden the patient population  who can benefit from CTLA- . That s because of improved binding to CD  . And we re seeing activity in patients  with both the low affinity and the high-affinity CD   allele.,0.2360603686538525
We believe AGEN     continues to show nothing less than extraordinary promise  as a differentiated anti-CTLA- . This potential is upheld  in the new data Agenus announced early in February that describes new  confirmed responses.,0.08936232887208462
As of February  a total of six confirmed responses with      monotherapy and      plus bal have been recorded -- reported in colon  ovarian and endometrial cancers  including two complete responses.,-0.015234931372106075
Further  we ve seen responses in cold tumors. These are tumors that have low tumor mutational burden  microsatellite stable disease and PD-L  negative tumors as well as BRCA negative tumors and tumors with a low affinity CD   allele.,-0.004907354057650082
This is what makes      unique. These are tumors where current IO therapy is largely ineffective. In addition  no debilitating neuroendocrine toxicities or liver toxicities have been observed  unlike what we see in patients treated with Yervoy  experiencing     to     toxicities.,0.14711971580982208
Looking ahead with       currently in Phase   development  our goal is a fast-to-market strategy  targeting indications that currently have few effective treatments. And in patients who have failed prior standard therapies.,0.08464952744543552
Trials are continuing with      alone  and in combination with balstilimab  with expanded cohorts  in microsatellite stable colorectal cancer  microsatellite stable endometrial cancer  non-small cell lung cancer and melanoma.,0.004156167298788205
With continued positive clinical data a registrational program expected to begin by the end of this year and it s with great excitement that we brought on board Dr. Steven O Day  an expert in delivering effective IO agents to patients with cancer.,0.46849606779869646
AGEN     alone and as the backbone of high-impact combination could be a foundational therapy  if approved  driving the next wave of IO treatments. Our initial registrational plan will focus on indications for rapid launch through the accelerated approval pathway as a monotherapy or on top of our PD-  or any approved PD- .,0.007680234397412278
Based on our preclinical and clinical data to-date  our ambitions with      plus PD-  are to be the dominant IO combination with the potential to overtake Yervoy and Opdivo or chemo and KEYTRUDA as the market leader. We re actively seeking the right partner to execute this strategy and dominate in this sector.,0.029357923893257976
At the upcoming AACR conference in April we ll present two abstracts featuring AGEN     alone and in combination with other IO mechanisms such as our anti-PD-  therapy  balstilimab. We ll showcase how the unique design of this molecule is expanding the benefit of this important target to drive responses in all polymorphic variants and the ability to provide clinical benefit in previously unresponsive tumors.,0.01565231612039497
We ll also show the benefit of adding      to other checkpoint inhibitors such as anti-PD-   anti-TIGIT  iNKT-activating therapy and adoptive T-cell therapy. Novel IO combinations will drive the next wave of IO therapy and Agenus believe that      alone and in combination with other mechanisms is the foundation of this next wave.,0.08651507741888054
Let s turn now for a moment to work on TIGIT. Not unlike CTLA-  and PD-   TIGIT is one of the key components in our immune system  it s found on T cells and by suppressing unnecessary activity like the activation of T cells  it helps keep the immune system properly balanced. Usually TIGIT is invaluable to good health  but in cancer patients TIGIT s suppression of the immune system allows tumors to grow.,0.07039600261487067
An important finding is that treatment with PD-  actually upregulates TIGIT consequently curbing the activity of TIGIT often using antibodies has become an area of intense R D efforts and anti-TIGIT therapy is set to be another breakthrough in IO. Agenus has two anti-TIGIT antibodies. This is AGEN     a monospecific antibody that s also engineered like AGEN     to improve performance.,0.043805943394545466
And AGEN      a bispecific antibody that includes a TIGIT arm that has also been engineered for Fc enhancement. As a potentially best-in-class agents we re prioritizing AGEN     for advancement into the clinic and expect to begin human studies this year. What makes AGEN     potential best-in-class  Similar to       we ve designed the front end of      for strong receptor binding in this case to TIGIT.,0.03147692600032315
We ve also engineered the Fc back-end for improved T cell and NK cell activation in order to more effectively unleash the immune system. We ve gone one step further with      by engineering it as a bispecific antibody  co-targeting a second tumor escape mechanism to create a double blockade against cancer escape. This dual blockade is designed to address a potential alternate escape mechanism to TIGIT therapy.,0.12369535220204853
Overall  we believe the combination of our Fc enhanced and co-targeting with our AGEN     bispecific gives it best-in-class potential. And as Garo mentioned  potentially provides strong efficacy not just in combination with other IO mechanisms  but also uniquely as a single agent. Some of this has already been demonstrated in preclinical tumor models and we eagerly anticipate clinical trials initiation this year.,0.32336781854974106
Our TIGIT strategy was also recently featured in our first episode of Agenus insights. This is our new R D mini-series that provides insight into impactful areas of research and Agenus  contributions to immuno-oncology. We encourage you to watch the replay and stay tuned for more episodes in the coming months.,0.15671981265040813
Through our AgenTus subsidiary  we ve developed a platform to produce invariant natural killer T cells or iNKTs. iNKTs are type of self-directed  intelligent immune cells  capable of producing responses from both the innate and the adaptive arms of the immune system.,0.0037898082882747985
iNKTs can combat multiple disease threats in an autonomous manner. In inflammatory disorders  iNKTs has helped to restore the balance of the immune system  correcting conditions like the cytokine storm that we see in patients with severe cases of COVID-  .,0.12342785368673503
Earlier this year  we announced preliminary Phase   data from our COVID trial currently ongoing. Dose escalation for an initiation into a Phase   trial is on track for the first half of this year and data readouts are expected in the fourth quarter.,0.008760258555412292
Now in cancer  iNKTs homing on tissues and direct the killing of tumor cells. They have an invariant TCR receptor. It doesn t need to be engineered to them. This will counter immune suppressor cells and block tumor escape mechanisms.,0.046909213066101074
You can imagine the benefit of this homing feature we observe in lung tissue in the infectious disease setting to be very impactful in diseases like lung cancer. And as the cell therapy iNKTs has the potential to be used on their own  and in combination with additional anti-cancer therapies such as those already in our pipeline.,0.12667801161296666
AgenTus  first iNKT Phase   trial in cancer is anticipated to start dosing during the first half of this year  and we re targeting human studies to be initiated in solid tumors soon thereafter.,-6.702262908220291e-06
And lastly  while we often discuss our IO pipeline compounds in isolation  there s clearly tremendous value in the combination potential for the cancer pathways we re targeting.,0.26121500972658396
PD-   CTLA-   TIGIT  iNKT therapy and other promising mechanisms and programs we have not yet discussed on this call. Stay tuned for more on these exciting developments in the balance of this year.,0.19704998325323686
I ll now turn the call over to our Chief Commercial Officer  Andy Hurley to elaborate on our excitement regarding AGEN    .,0.14617201825603843
Andy Hurley,0.0028687235462712124
Thank you  Jen. My decision to join the Agenus team was driven by the excitement we all feel and the opportunities we have here under one roof. I m also driven by our near-term prospects  which I believe could create substantial value.,0.46526911163527984
I m particularly excited by how we can take our PD-  balstilimab  and potentially grow it into a major franchise with a superior combination potential with AGEN    . I believe      will significantly expand the commercial opportunity of our anti-PD-  with the potential to outperform current IO combinations.,0.4735558340762509
The clinical results to date have been very exciting  both as a monotherapy and in combinations across a wide array of tumor types. Specifically  as Jen said  cold tumors  such as microsatellite stable tumors  represent a significant portion within colorectal and endometrial cancers.,0.28702027862891555
And traditional PD-  anti-CTLA-  inhibitor therapies have not been as effective here. These are tumors  which don t generally respond to cancer immunotherapy  and yet we are seeing responses with AGEN    .,-0.09399930108338594
Practically and conceptually  we re not limited to any tumor type if the current response trends we are seeing continue. It s really a function of picky patients certifications  which can get us to the finish line quickly and leverage this to expand on our broader opportunities.,0.2831140345952008
Having our own PD-  to pair with our superior CTLA-  and then having our own unique CTLA-   which can add significant value to our PD-   are advantages which are very exciting for us to pursue.,0.4181004316196777
And then  there s the rest of our pipeline  including our intelligent  cell therapy program  our vaccines and exciting pipeline of antibodies with compelling early data. I feel the privilege of working with an exceptional team of people across all disciplines.,0.3604965473350603
I have worked at highly successful companies  but what we have here is very unique and exciting. I hope to interact with you more frequently  and do a deeper dive on our commercial strategy to create something exceptional.,0.43838829186279327
I appreciate the opportunity to express my plans. And I ll now turn the call over to Christine Klaskin to review our financials.,0.4200915340334177

Yeah. Hey  guys. This is Jeet on for Biren. Thanks for taking my questions. Congratulations on the progress to date. I m looking forward to updates this year. Could you just maybe walk me through the timing perhaps between the bal BLA filing  and when you actually anticipate submitting the combo and perhaps when ultimate approval is perhaps expected there  And then second  just if you could talk through perhaps some of your go-to-market efforts to this point and any goals for the remainder of this year  and if there s any color on discussions with payers or thoughts on pricing that would be great. Thank you.,0.2429593075066805
Garo Armen,-0.023363035870715976
Thank you  Biren. Let me start out addressing the bal zal question. As you know and as we sort of alluded to  as data matures  looking at our past performance with data disclosures  we re delighted to see that the data is getting better. And I think given the size of our company and given the enormous demands on us for regulatory undertakings  we ve made a decision several months ago which we articulated to the investment community that our first priority is to file our BLA with balstilimab. And once that s done  we will provide additional guidance for our timelines associated with our bal zal filing. And of course  that will include disclosure of more mature data which we re in the process of addressing both from a public disclosure perspective as well as disclosing it to the agency.,0.17037191265262663

Got it.,0.359866094077006
Garo Armen,-0.023363035870715976
As to go-to-market strategy  I m assuming you re talking about go-to-product market strategy. And with that  I think  Andy  are you prepared to give us some initial remarks ,0.005089277401566505
Andy Hurley,0.0028687235462712124
Sure. Yes  it s a good question. I ve been here in a limited amount of time  but I can tell you that the launch planning is underway. We re really evaluating how we re going to really address the unmet needs in the marketplace and position this product in a way that addresses those unmet needs both at a physician level as well as on a patient level.,0.277019189321436
At the patient level  you bring up the question on pricing and access  that s going to be one of our absolute paramount priorities is just to ensure unencumbered access to balstilimab  as we look at the landscape that that s going to follow. We look at this as a pivotal part in our relationship with payers because we don t believe this is going to be  of course  our first and only into the marketplace.,0.003202110528945923
We want to be able to follow on with other products  and establishing those relationships and making sure that they understand our goals  which is unencumbered patient access is going to be really key. So  we re going to be starting those discussions with payers. We ve done a lot of market research to understand really what are the drivers to position our product  and we re really encouraged by what we re hearing to be able to offer that in a setting both at the physician and patient level.,0.22754066169727594
So  I can tell you that I m week four into the role. And ultimately  I m very encouraged by the level of effort that s already been put in and our planning moving forward.,0.43629970715846866
Unidentified Analyst,-0.020186680369079113
Got it. And if I could just ask one more follow-up question. On       it seems like the AACR presentation will be fairly preclinical in nature. Just wanted to know if we can anticipate perhaps a robust clinical update on that perhaps later this year  and if we ll maybe get us a look at that Phase   data in colorectal  Thanks.,0.06709036231040955
Jennifer Buell,0.0014714345597894862
Hi  Jeet. Thanks for the question. Actually AACR certainly will include some pre-clinical information  but of course  we will also provide a clinical update on where we are with the programs  so stay tuned for more on that.,0.2101162683684379

Our next question comes from Mayank Mamtani with B. Riley Securities.,0.0009694130276329815
Mayank Mamtani,0.001143528614193201
Good morning team. Appreciate the comprehensive update and thanks for taking my questions  and great to have Dr. O Day and Andy be part of the discussion. So maybe just piggybacking on the previous question on the upcoming      clinical data at AACR  would you also have more updated cutoff relative to February    Could you just clarify that  And maybe Dr. O Day if you could comment on why MSS colorectal indication kind of makes the first to pursue as you think about fast  ph  to market  Can you just talk about the dynamics of that indication ,0.4015911358874291
Jennifer Buell,0.0014714345597894862
So  before I turn it over to Dr. O Day  Mayank  thanks for your question. At AACR  yes  we will have a more mature data than what we ve previously disclosed  and this will include more information on duration as well as potential new responses in the program too. Now  I ll turn it over to Dr. O Day to give you his thinking on MSS colorectal cancer.,0.25528024649247527
Steven O Day,0.002721953234868124
Thank you Mayank. Well  as Jenny said  I m new to the company in recent months  but I have had the unique opportunity to be involved with      over the course of the last several years both in learning about its exciting clinical drug design as well as pre-clinical data and then obviously being involved as the principal investigator in the      Phase   trial.,0.46009838706231676
What s exciting to me is the pre-clinical data of more activity and T-reg depletion  as well as more potential access to low affinity CD   alleles all seems to be playing out so far in the clinic with our Phase I trial.,0.42350969556719065
As you can imagine  with the competitive nature and approvals across I-O indications in solid tumors  Phase I trials attract fairly cold tumors that are MS-stable and there s no surprise that our trial has attracted those patients  particularly colorectal endometrial MS stable ovarian and others.,-0.026626940816640854
And what s exciting to me is to see objective responses  obviously in both      monotherapy in combinations in these cold tumors that are predominantly PD-L  negative MS stable low tumor burden  and interestingly  in CD   lower heterozygous affinity polymorphisms  which is all consistent with preclinical data.,0.2805581968277693
So given that fact  obviously  I m excited to be part of the development of this drug as we go forward. And colorectal MS stable cohorts are clearly a huge unmet need with a low bar in the second and third-line setting.,0.19955061748623848
So  we re going to follow the data and expand these cohorts in cold tumors as well as look at our warm-to-hot tumors  both lung and then cutaneous tumors  melanoma  and non-melanoma cutaneous skin tumors are real opportunities for us to look both at this agent and single agent as well as combination. So  it s going to be exciting coming year for me and my clinical team to develop this very exciting drug.,0.4838316076347837
Mayank Mamtani,0.001143528614193201
Fantastic. That s very helpful. And then on -- two quick ones for Jen  and I have one more for Garo to close. Jen  what would be the path for QS-   just from a clinical development standpoint  And also on the TIGIT bispecific  when do you expect disclosing the other target you re working on ,0.4972163720813114
Jennifer Buell,0.0014714345597894862
So Mayank  I m here. So let me start with TIGIT disclosing. As you can imagine  this is an incredibly competitive space. We have a bispecific that is a first of its kind we believe and it s designed really to address an entirely new area. So we will not be disclosing that anytime soon  but we ll certainly keep you informed as the data continue to progress both preclinically and then clinically and that may drive our decision on disclosures.,0.14728224999271333
For QS-    the development is really straightforward. So as you know  Bill   Melinda Gates Foundation had invested in our initiative to advance a sustainable supply of QS-  . We ve done so we re in the process of doing so  but we ve already generated early data and demonstrated the bio-comparability of this new supply compared to the previous clinic version  which is now in the approved Shingrix vaccine as you know.,0.2763389184838161
So the development is straightforward. It s preclinical comparability. And then the clinical program will be very abbreviated to bring this product into market with a number of vaccine products underway. And particularly  at this time when we see the criticality of effective vaccines  we know that historical vaccines no longer cut it. Flu vaccines at     efficacy just won t do it. So we need to improve our ability to take antigens allow for mass global production of those and this is where QS-   is really critical at antigen sparing allowing a fewer number or lower amount of antigens to actually be quite effective. As you see with Shingrix  it s over      up to     effective in adults and gets better with age. These are the kinds of findings that we re going to need across the board as we deal with these mutating viruses repeatedly.,-0.18353062868118286
Mayank Mamtani,0.001143528614193201
Okay. Very helpful. So I think a number of different disease indications that you may consider including flu  including COVID  even Shingrix. Understood. Then  last for Garo  as you think about the cash accretive transactions  just can you just high level talk to the framework that you guys are kind of evaluating internally. When you think about prosecuting these opportunities across the board more advanced late-stage versus earlier stage programs  Kind of  how do you think about a lot of push and pull that might be associated with these transactions ,0.05887800455093384
Garo Armen,-0.023363035870715976
Right. So all I can tell you right now is  stay tuned. As I said  in the second quarter  starting in the second quarter  we will see cash-accretive transactions including corporate transactions. So unfortunately  I cannot disclose anything more than that right now.,-0.3651132225058973

MattPhipps,0.021716057555750012
Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So this morning Sanofi and Regeneron announced positive Phase III results of Libtayo in cervical cancer. I know you guys had previously kind of hinted at meeting to get that accelerated approval BLA in before a full approval was there. I assume  given you guys are close to finishing the bal BLA that the Phase III positive results aren t going to affect that at this point  but just wanted to confirm.,0.4069677162915468
Jennifer Buell,0.0014714345597894862
Hi Matt. Thanks for the question. Yes  I agree with you. So  the accelerated approval pathway remains open until full approval is granted in the same indication. Based on where we are with our filing  we don t believe this will impact our plans.,0.10741258691996336
MattPhipps,0.021716057555750012

Thank you  Christian. Good afternoon  everyone. Welcome to Alta s fourth quarter and full year      earnings conference call. On the call with us today are Ryan Greenawalt  our Chairman and CEO  and Tony Colucci  our Chief Financial Officer. For today s call management will first provide a review of the fourth quarter and the full year financial results. And then we will conduct a Q A session. We will begin with some prepared remarks before we open the call for your question.,0.41809626956819557
Before we get started  I d like to remind everyone that this conference call may contain certain forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of       reflecting management s current expectations regarding future results of operations  our business strategy  financial outlook  achievements of the company  and other non-historical statements as described in our press release. These forward-looking statements are subject to both  known and unknown risks  uncertainties and assumptions including those related to all sales growth  market opportunities  and general economic and business conditions. We have based these forward-looking statements largely on our current expectations and projections about future events  and financial trends that we believe may affect our business  financial condition  and results of operations. Although  we believe these expectations reasonable  we undertake no obligation to revise any statements to reflect changes that occur after this call.

Ryan Greenawalt,-5.506275920197368e-05
Thank you  Sinem and welcome  everyone. Thank you for joining Alta Equipment Group s fourth quarter      earnings call. Our strong performance and solid financial results in the fourth quarter capped off a transformative and very successful      despite the significant impact of the COVID pandemic. We achieved several important accomplishments which I ll briefly touch on before turning the call over to Tony for a financial review of the fourth quarter and full year.,0.48601661817519926
The operating environment for our services continued to improve from the prior quarter as customer demand increased consecutively each month in the fourth quarter. Labor productivity  which is the heartbeat of our operations increased to benchmark levels before the end of the year. In response to increased sales activity and demand for labor hours  we added to our product support workforce both  organically and through acquisitions and ended the year with over     skilled technicians  an increase of approximately     technicians year-over-year  and representing roughly half of our total headcount. Our entire Alta team once again rose to the occasion during these difficult times demonstrating incredible dedication and delivered on our commitment to exceptional service and equipment uptime. A sincere thank you to all of our employees who make Alta the great company it is today.,0.18730400130152702
And touching on our financial highlights  fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA came in at    .  million on revenue of     .  million. We reached a true milestone in delivering over    billion in revenue on a pro forma basis with adjusted pro forma EBITDA of    .  million for the year. Our liquidity position remains strong and our balance sheet flexible in providing the support needed to execute our organic and acquisition growth strategy. And looking at the full year  we overcame many challenges that we faced due to the COVID pandemic and navigated the business through unprecedented shutdowns. We were designated as an essential business and remain fully operational at all of our    branches across    states. Our variable cost structure and the dexterity of our business model allows management to swiftly implement cost reduction measures to efficiently manage the business and sustain positive adjusted EBITDA and mitigate against margin declines. The revenue decline was less than anticipated and business activity began to pick up from the April trough through the end of the year.,0.09336744688334875
As we move through the recovery in the second half of the year  we reduced some of the cost mitigation measures and began calling back skilled technicians who were furloughed as big business activity returned to pre-COVID levels. The diversity of both  our geographies and our end-markets enabled us to weather the pandemic storm. Also as a reflection of our business model  our product support revenue remained strong during this period and grew     in       compared to the prior year when including our required revenues. In      consistent with our acquisition strategy  we expanded our geographic footprint  established relationships with new OEM partners  and further diversified our end-market reach. In the fourth quarter  we completed two accretive acquisitions that increased our scale and strengthened our business profile. We acquired the construction dealership assets of Vantage Equipment which operates three branches in the northern region of New York State. Alta is now the authorized distributor of Volvo products in most of New York State  a region that offers significant additional expansion opportunities. Vantage also diversifies our customer base and serves as a great complement to our Lifttech business which serves the New York material handling market. This combination is powerful and allows us to bring our full resources to this large and growing market.,0.06940131890587509
As we mentioned on our third quarter earnings call  we closed the Howell Tractor and Equipment acquisitions in late October. Howell serves the Northern Illinois and Northwest Indiana construction markets with a wide range of construction and crane equipment. Howell enjoys a strong relationship with leading manufacturers such as Sennebogen  which is a new addition to Alta s product line in the region.,0.07310528648667969
Looking at the full year  we completed seven acquisitions which in total contributed approximately     million to adjusted EBITDA in       our most active year on the M A front. Alta has become the partner of choice in the fragmented equipment dealer market as we provide manufacturers the benefit of our scale  liquidity and reputation to facilitate share growth and customer loyalty. The structural supply demand and balance between buyers and sellers in our industry remains intact and we continue to execute on our growth strategy.,0.0991332595658605
As we noted in today s news release  we ve rebranded our Industrial Segments and Material Handling. Material Handling is the recognized industry vernacular and better describes the range of our capabilities. The rebranding will have particular significance of messaging to the e-commerce sector which values the integration of Material Handling equipment with the more sophisticated systems offerings. PeakLogix  a national material handling systems integrator we acquired in mid-year has significantly enhanced our positioning in this area and provides us with a competitive advantage in the fast growing  warehousing and logistics market  which has only continued to pick up steam as the recovery continuous. Peak offers a complete material management solution and delivers efficiency and increased productivity for it s customers. We ve been able to cross-sell and promote their services across our entire material handling customer base  and integrate them with our other warehouse automation solutions.,0.17109084287949372
We also expanded our full service capabilities in this area  more recently with a small but strategic acquisition in ScottTech  which provides warehouse control software and systems. It is important to highlight that these new systems integration services are unconstrained by our dealership territories and both acquired businesses have customers throughout the U.S. and internationally.,0.02343058752012439
And looking forward we see a clear path to a full recovery as the recovery takes hold and the year progresses. The investments we ve made in technology products and people position us well to continue our strong performance entering     . We re encouraged by the positive trends we re seeing  especially by the strong secular tailwinds that are apparent in our material handling and construction segments. E-commerce growth is driving higher volumes from large retailers who warehouse their products which increases our opportunity to expand and lean into this area of the business. The demand for automation and more complex systems and technology in warehousing and material handling has never been greater  and we believe it is in the early stages. There is clearly upside from potential federal stimulus and pent-up demand for capital projects to improve our net -- our aging national infrastructure. Alta s strong relationships with leading OEMs and our recent geographic market expansion position us to be a great partner for both  material handling and construction equipment markets.,0.1784215250663692
This was truly a transformative year by any measure  we believe our strong financial results in our first year as a public company demonstrate the outstanding execution of our resilient dealership model and our operational discipline through a difficult and unprecedented time. We are exciting -- excited and increasingly confident in our ability to deliver increased financial results and enhanced shareholder value moving forward. I d like to thank our manufacturing partners for their support  our dedicated employees for their hard work  and our shareholders for their support and confidence in the company.,0.4784994055844436
With that  I ll now turn it over to Tony for his financial review.,0.01716258004307747
Tony Colucci,0.0006809440237702802
Thank you  Ryan and good evening  everyone. Thank you for your interest in Alta Equipment Group and our fourth quarter and full year      financial results.,0.4970372101670364
Before I start  I first want to congratulate all of my Alta colleagues  and all of Alta s shareholders on our one year anniversary as a public company. The past year has been equal parts challenging and exciting. Navigating a global pandemic certainly wasn t part of our plan as we entered the public markets    months ago  but our business and most importantly  Alta s employees rose to COVID s challenge and delivered a performance that Ryan and I are extremely grateful for  and proud of. Additionally  I want to welcome our new team members at Vantage Equipment  and ScottTech in upstate New York to the Alta family. The senior leadership team is excited about integrating your talents into our business and into Alta s one team culture. We look forward to earning your trust.,0.48579981293005403
My remarks today will focus on four key areas  first  I ll be presenting our fourth quarter performance  which we are pleased with. As the business continues to close in the COVID gap and gain ground year-over-year on some key metrics. I ll be focusing in on specific departmental revenue figures  organic cash flows and rental fleet fluctuations  and outperformance on these metrics impacted the balance sheet and our leverage profile in a positive way. Second  I ll be discussing our full year      performance and sequential quarter-over-quarter trends in two of our key performance indicators. Specifically  I ll discuss how those KPI trends correlated to EBITDA performance for the year  and how those      trends compared to       a year reflective of a more typical business climate. Third  I want to touch on year-end acquisition of Vantage Equipment  how we thought about the return profile of our investment when compared to the cost of capital associated with the preferred stock we raised to fund the transaction. I also want to provide some high level financial figures on the ScottTech acquisition that we closed at the beginning of this month. Lastly  I ll discuss the balance sheet  and in particular  our leverage and liquidity position as we entered     .,0.057573709258576855
Real quickly  it should be noted that there are some slides in our presentation which was released prior to our call today that presents our fourth quarter and full year numbers in greater detail than what I will discuss today. I d encourage everyone on today s call to review our presentation  and our   -K which is available on our Investor Relations website at altaequipment.com.,0.21793531073490158
With the first portion of my prepared remarks  fourth quarter performance. First  let s talk about the profit and loss statement. For the quarter  the company recorded revenue of      million  which is a record sales number for Alta. I ll get into what drove that figure to such a high level in a moment but the      million represents a     million sequential increase over Q  and a  .   increase on an organic basis versus Q      . From an EBITDA perspective  we realized    .  million in adjusted EBITDA for the quarter  up from    .  million in the third quarter of     . Importantly  our adjusted pro forma EBITDA for Q   which assumes we had owned Vantage and Howell for the entire quarter was    .  million  or   .  million less than Q  of     . I ll come back to that   .  million EBITDA variance a little later in my comments.,0.024581336649134755
Next  I d like to talk about organic cash flows in the fourth quarter. First  I mentioned the      million in revenue a moment ago  and how that was a record sales number for the business. Just to focus in on that briefly  on previous calls I mentioned how the fourth quarter is typically the largest equipment sales quarter of the year for Alta  and in particular  it s historically been our largest rental equipment sales quarter of the year. Really in a bit further  new and used equipment sales were      million for the quarter  a     million increase over Q   another record number. But importantly  we recorded an additional     million of rental equipment sales for the quarter  a number that is two times the amount sold in Q      .,0.012554874643683434
The reason why I focused on the     million rental disposal number is because it led to a net decrease of    .  million in rental fleet  which when coupled with our EBITDA for the quarter led to an organic delivering of approximately     million  and an unlevered free cash flow conversion on EBITDA factor of over      for Q      . We believe this organic delevering to be a powerful indication on the marketability of our rental fleet assets and our ability to generate cash flow and liquidity by optimizing our rental fleet in a short period of time. On an organic basis  we believe this to be the story of the quarter.,0.05687237996608019
Few other P L highlights before I move on. And just to jump back to the equipment sales number in Q  just for a second  let s keep in mind our razor and blade business model. The      million in equipment sales for the quarter is now customer field population which bodes well for the future of our high margin product support departments. Another encouraging metric from the P L  we saw a   .  million rental revenue increase over Q       on an organic basis  an indication of continued strengthening in our rental business. And importantly  continued year-over-year organic growth in our parts and service departments in our construction segment.,0.21969013032503426
Moving on to the second key area of my prepared remarks. I d like to focus on some high level pro forma numbers for the full year      and certain quarter-over-quarter trends in key performance indicators we observed throughout the year. First  for the fiscal year       as Ryan mentioned  on a pro forma basis our annual revenue is now slightly above the    billion mark. And on an adjusted pro forma basis  our EBITDA as of the year -- as of year-end was nearly      million. A few key points and trends to point out is we do a look back on       and I d like to refer everyone to Slide    of our earnings presentation which depicts the data I ll be referring to.,0.0420983973890543
First  as we ve discussed on previous calls  two major drivers of EBITDA cash flows in our business correlate to two key performance indicators we track  labor productivity and rental fleet utilization. Of note and discussed on prior calls  we saw the bottom in labor productivity in Q       began to recover on the metric in Q   and I m happy to report that we were able to achieve pre-COVID labor productivity levels in Q   that trend has continued as we moved into Q . So for labor productivity  a V-shaped recovery to be sure  and with positive trends headed into     .,0.18455363053362817
Second  rental utilization which I -- which as I have mentioned previously  has lagged historic levels realized in our business. And as you will note on slide     our physical utilization variants versus the prior years followed a similar trend that labor productivity followed in     . We began to see the follow-up towards the end of Q   the year-on-year variance was most acute in Q   we started recovering in Q   and continued to close the gap in Q . Now  unlike labor productivity  as of the end of the year  we have yet to fully close the gap on rental utilization. Having said that  and importantly  the early signs in Q  are encouraging and suggest a continued closing of the gap.,-0.08720753714442253
So  in summary  as we looked at these two key KPIs and how they trended throughout       and we correlate them against our EBITDA performance throughout the year  we noticed similar trend in terms of the gap versus historic norms. Again  referring to slide    you will note that our year-on-year EBITDA performance mimics the trends observed in the two KPIs. In summary  of the    .  million in EBITDA variance for the year  approximately     was incurred in Q  and Q . Importantly  as with both the KPIs  we continue to narrow the year-on-year EBITDA gap here in Q  with the gap being   .  million on a pro forma basis for the quarter versus a   .  million gap in Q      .,0.011709796264767647
Last item of note in this section of my commentary  the turbulence of      disguised a typical seasonality in our business  and in particular  the seasonality of our EBITDA. In the EBITDA look-back chart on slide     you will note that almost     of our pro forma      EBITDA more typically and expectedly given our construction  Technical Difficulty  annual EBITDA  Q  and Q  delivered     and     each  and  Technical Difficulty  the macro backdrop  Technical Difficulty .,-0.010087819769978523
For the third area of my prepared remarks  I d like to briefly touch on our recent M A activity in the preferred stock offering we contemplated  Technical Difficulty . For the year  we completed our acquisition of Vantage at an additional     million of revenue. The acquisition further expands our territorial reach with Volvo and provides for natural synergies with Lifttech  our material handling operation in upstate New York. At a total enterprise value of about     million  we believe the deal to be accretive from an EBITDA multiple standpoint  as well as in comparison to the cost of capital we sourced to fund the transaction  which was the preferred stock offering we completed in concert with the acquisition.,0.06574898592953105
With approximately    technicians serving a market territory known to be greater in size in our established Michigan territory  where we staff more than     technicians  we see -- we see a tremendous aftermarket opportunity and expect to double the size of that business overtime  thereby furthering the accretion over the cost of capital used to fund the deal.,0.07849948457442224
Onto ScottTech  on March    we completed the acquisition of ScottTech Integrated Solution as a complement to our PeakLogix acquisition completed in the middle of     . Specializing a warehouse management software and systems integration  we believe the combination of PeakLogix and ScottTech further expands our full solution product offerings and increases our commitment to the emerging technology space. At a purchase price of approximately   .  million  the acquisition adds approximately     million of revenue in close to a    million of annual EBITDA to the enterprise.,0.03866135669522919
For the last part of my prepared remarks  I want to give a quick update on the balance sheet and our credit profile at the end of Q . Two key factors here to discuss  leverage and liquidity. First  leverage. I mentioned early in the call  we realized an organic de-leveraging in the business by virtue of our big quarter in rental equipment sales. That factor alongside solid EBITDA performance in the quarter and the use of the preferred stock offering to fund advantage acquisition all led to total leverage reducing from about  . x EBITDA in Q  to  . x at year end  which with senior leverage dropping to  . x  with both leverage ratios being well inside our leverage covenants.,0.014430685492698103
Touching on liquidity. And we feel really good about our position here. Recall that we closed the IPO with roughly      million in cash and revolving liquidity. Since the IPO in mid-February  we ve acquired five  and now at six strategic business funding growth CapEx in our rental fleets  specifically in an emerging market like Florida  in service the cash cost of our debt. As of the end of Q   I m happy to report  the business held the same level of liquidity that it had at the IPO or approximately      million. We believe holding liquidity at these levels  given all the challenges and activity that      presented to be an impressive result  a reflection of our cash flow profile and a strong collateral base  which we use to fund important strategic investments. This is also a testament to how we thoughtfully positioned our capital structure and how we fund M A.,0.2959108375944197
In closing  I want to thank all of my teammates at Alta for your commitment to the business and to each other throughout     . To our investors  we appreciate the opportunity to be stewards of your capital  and appreciate your support as we navigated our first year as a public company.

A couple of quick questions. Your adjusted EBITDA margins today are around    . Can you talk about some of the drivers to margin expansion in      and beyond ,0.024441455956548452
Tony Colucci,0.0006809440237702802
Sure  Alex. When we look back at the fourth quarter there  I ve made special note in my comments about the large amount of rental equipment sales. And so for the quarter  it s going to feel like  it s going to look like that our EBITDA margins were depressed  but it really was a function of all of the equipment sales and to refer back to the razor and the blades concept that s inherent in our business model. As you know  razors don t have as good of margin as the blades and so that that mix got thrown out of whack there in the fourth quarter. As we drive forward here  obviously the business model is to continue to grow  feel the  ph  population  build the product support business  which is higher margin in the future. So we would think that the mix  as we continue to move along  won t be the same as it was in the fourth quarter and shift more kind of appropriately back toward a more regular mix of parts and service  thereby kind of driving that EBITDA margin a little bit further north in the future. When we think about rental  EBITDA margins on rental are very high as well. We had some positive news there and it continue to trend in the appropriate direction. So  so long as rental continues to trend  that will also drive the EBITDA margin higher.,-0.22809555009007454
Alex Rygiel,0.0009267331042792648
And then could you maybe talk a little bit about which customer categories are rebounding the quickest  post-COVID here  And which ones are rebounding slower and maybe add some thoughts on whether or not those slower customer categories could catch up ,-0.23439517337828875
Ryan Greenawalt,-5.506275920197368e-05
Sure  Alex. This is Ryan. So a couple areas that are rebounding faster at our home turf is the automotive industry in our home state of Michigan. And then throughout our material handling dealership footprint  anything related to the warehousing market has remained steady and is accelerating. Also with supply constraints  anything related to steel  the scrap industry is hot right now. That s a component of our business  scrap demolition in the steel industry on the construction side.,-0.06793144345283508
Alex Rygiel,0.0009267331042792648
And then lastly on M A. Can you talk a little bit about your M A pipeline  both within sort of your core business lines  as well as thoughts about adding a third leg ,-0.04505554586648941
Ryan Greenawalt,-5.506275920197368e-05
Sure. We think about the first leg being territorial expansion with our two most significant OEM partners. And those opportunities  we re always watching for  but there has to be a catalyst  some kind of succession planning issue or a catalyst  a reason for one of the ownership groups to be looking for an exit. What we have a lot of  is infill opportunities  which there were several examples of that last year. As we as we look to some of these markets where we re less mature or the new entrants and taking over territories where we can grow share  we ll be looking to build the product portfolio and there could certainly be an M A component of that talking in smaller dealerships in our existing footprint. And in terms of the third segment  as we mentioned on the last call  we re very focused on kind of watching the evolution of transportation  the electrification of the over the road fleet. Over the road  the truck segment is something that we d like to be in long term. And as the business evolves  we think that we re really well-positioned with our experience in both electric  on the battery side and the fuel cell side from our material handling business. So those are conversations that we re open to. It s sort of very active time. A lot of new companies coming to market and that we do envision something long term in that sector.,0.023219007067382336

Michael Shlisky,0.0004587369621731341
Good afternoon  guys. Can we can we just get back to the  indiscernible  I may have missed it. Can you repeat back with the organic growth was in the quarter  And of the various revenue categories that you have in your release in your   -K  which ones were the biggest drivers of that while the other things are going to be up for sure ,0.1948341578245163
Ryan Greenawalt,-5.506275920197368e-05
Mike  I ll take the first half of that. I think your question was the organic growth for the quarter. I think the number was  .   as an enterprise. Yes   .  . What was the second half of your question  Mike ,-0.005185538902878761
Michael Shlisky,0.0004587369621731341
I was just curious as to which categories of revenue drove the organic growth the most ,0.0525303790345788
Ryan Greenawalt,-5.506275920197368e-05
Oh  yes  by in large Mike  it was the equipment sales as I mentioned. Rental equipment sales. As customers  we get toward year end  customers have capital budgets that maybe they re looking to get rid of for the year  if you will. We also have customers that have historically looked to take advantage of bonus depreciation from a tax perspective. And so  the fourth quarter is usually overweight equipment sales and it was again this year  probably more than we expected. But that equipment sales number is what s driving a lot of the organic growth. We did have organic growth  as we mentioned in the rental line in parts and service and construction as well. Which all kind of bodes well when you kind of peel the layers back here.,0.006571188569068909
Michael Shlisky,0.0004587369621731341
Got it. I also wanted to ask about your rental fleet here in     . I ll have little  ph  spent some time during the downturn  kind of pairing assets  making sure they had  ph  -- it was the best performers and the best outlook. Did you allow that during Q  to Q   And of course you have a better performance ahead for the rental fleet from a margin perspective in      ,0.2130200732499361
Tony Colucci,0.0006809440237702802
Yes  Mike  this is Tony. I ll take that one. So  when we think about rental  we re thinking always about utilization and cash flows off of it. Not necessarily gross margin  because there s so much depreciation in there. But as we move through Q  and Q   we had already kind of committed to making some investments down in Florida  with the Flagler acquisition and adding rental fleet down there. We think long term that it s still the right thing to do. And what we did here in the fourth quarter was kind of optimize a little bit. I mentioned the reduction of about     million in organic kind of acquisition costs here. As we left the year end as you ll see  in our numbers  we got roughly a      million fleet headed into     . We feel good about that fleet level. It may ebb and flow. If we have a      million fleet  you ll see in our numbers we turned over almost a quarter of that fleet in the year  which is part of our business model is that rent-to-sell  ph  with the heavy equipment to get it out in the field population. So at any rate  the fleet may ebb and flow a little bit  but by in large  the expectation here is that we re going to keep the fleet kind of in that same level  let the market kind of decide demand to see if we re going to expand  or if we have to pair back some more. But we don t at this point have expectation of growing the fleet in any material way.,0.18747368082404137
Michael Shlisky,0.0004587369621731341
Great. And then one last one from me. The EBITDA that we saw in Q  and the exit rate for the year  is that a good sort of baseline minimum for the full year  adding in perhaps maybe    million to     million for the last two deals a bit in the fourth quarter  And from there  do you have any sense as to what you might get from close  ph  perspective in      ,0.020974352955818176
Tony Colucci,0.0006809440237702802
Yes. Good question  Mike. The number that I would refer you to in the fourth quarter as kind of a good metric to maybe build off as we move along here is the    .  million of pro forma EBITDA for the fourth quarter. I made special mention of kind of the seasonality here as we as we go along and how that seasonality kind of gets flipped around a little bit in     . But  I think that fourth quarter numbers are a good one to build off of. Relative to organic growth we have the coming off of       we would we would expect some. We re impacted by COVID  so we certainly think we ll be jumping off of      levels. How much  It kind of remains to be seen and I m not sure we re prepared to give a number at this point.,0.2035868400707841

Bryan Fast,0.058052114909514785
Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions here. Just trying to get a gauge of how supply channels are looking right now. Have you had any issues  I guess sourcing parts or equipment quick lease  ph   Or are you seeing some delays here ,0.39018235821276903
Ryan Greenawalt,-5.506275920197368e-05
We re definitely seeing delays in areas. So equipment lead times are starting to stretch in certain product categories  the constraints on steel and other materials are definitely being felt. We always try to remind that we can withstand short-term variability and things like that. We use our rental fleet to fill in for our customer needs and the flip side of that is we see firming up of pricing and utilization on both rental rates and time utilization  but also on the used side  things that are definitely appreciating today.,0.20965872332453728

Tony Colucci,0.0006809440237702802
This is Tony  Brian. Thanks for joining. The one metric that I think we could -- we don t have the number top of mind in terms of how many organic hires we add  if you will  throughout the year. And it gets a little foggy with given COVID and the furloughs and so on and so forth. The one metric that we are kind of pointing to is we ve talked a lot about the aftermarket opportunity we saw down at Flagler in Florida. When we took that dealership over  they had    technicians. I think we closed the year with    technicians on staff down there. So growing in all the right areas where there s a lot of opportunity. Now that same     increase or whatever the number is there --     maybe -- we would not have realized that in other areas. It would have been more muted than that.

Thanks. A couple questions. First  you just mentioned that you re seeing pricing firming on the rental utilization in the used side of things. With that then  when would you expect the rental utilization gap to be fully closed at this point  Or maybe you re already seeing that in early       So maybe talk about that a little bit ,-0.0005581863224506378
Tony Colucci,0.0006809440237702802
Matt  thanks for joining. This is Tony. Good question. As I ve mentioned in my prepared remarks  in Q   we re off to a good start in terms of continued closing of the gap  if you will. Will we get there in Q   I think it still remains to be seen. I like to say by the end of Q   we would see that utilization gap close. I think the comment that I would make is if we continue to see trends of what we see here in Q   that utilization gap will get closed here  hopefully by the middle of the year  or in Q  at some point. But we re gaining on it every day.,0.3027565348893404
Matt Summerville,0.0011779875785578042
Then with respect to the actual utilization rate  can you give us a sense as to where they are currently  Maybe versus where they were just pre-COVID  And maybe where they trough during COVID  Just to kind of frame that up a little better and more specifically ,-0.10791895724833012
Tony Colucci,0.0006809440237702802
Yes. I think the way that I would answer that  Matt  is if had      of rental fleet  kind of on the hand acquisition costs  in a more normal situation  we might have     or     of that out on rent. The variance that we saw and the shocks that we saw was something like take     off of that figure. So the     becomes      if you will  and then you can kind of extrapolate that into our business. You can kind of see what happens to EBITDA so on and so forth thereafter. But again  rough math that s kind of what we saw. And it was in the pockets of the fleet. Our material handling fleet didn t see as big of a shock that our construction fleet did in Q  and Q . So the     figures that I gave you is kind of the mix and the most acute that we saw when you kind of fully mix the entire fleet together.,-0.07299144193530083

Got it. And then just two more quick ones. We can do the algebra later  but just to save the time  can you provide us what the organic revenue number was for material handling  And then can you also comment from an M A perspective  I would imagine the assets that are serving the material handling side of warehousing  logistics  ecommerce  they were starting to see some multiple inflation there. So are those transactions -- do you have anything sort of in the pipeline serving that market  Or is that something that you re happy with the asset base to have in the organic opportunity in front of you that maybe you re not looking at organically now there  Thank you.,-0.015704765915870667

I m going to take the second part of that question while Tony does the math on the first part of the question. So for the kind of non-mobile equipment  the warehouse solutions and the more systems-oriented businesses that we acquired last year and then earlier this year  we are looking for opportunities. We would be opportunistic if we saw something  but we think that we have the platform that we need. This is a business that we acquired intellectual property and now you could think of it as we ve taken a group that had half a dozen salespeople on the stream today. They have over     material handling sales professionals out looking  mining for opportunities. We think that they ll be very busy for the foreseeable future off of the platform we already have.
